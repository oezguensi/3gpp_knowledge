# Introduction


The railway community is considering a successor communication system
to GSM\-R, as the forecasted obsolescence of the 2G\-based GSM\-R
technology is envisaged around 2030, with first FRMCS trial
implementations expected to start around 2020\.


The Future Railway Mobile Communication System (FRMCS) Functional
Working Group (FWG) of the International Union of Railways (UIC) have
investigated and summarised their requirements for the next generation
railway communication system in the Future Railway Mobile Communication
User Requirements Specification (FRMCS URS) \[2]. The present document is
based on this input given by the UIC/ETSI TC\-RT


# 1 Scope


The present document analyses FRMCS Use cases, system principles of
FRMCS and Interworking between GSM\-R and FRMCS in order to derive
potential requirements.

# 3 Definitions, and
abbreviations


## 3\.1 Definitions


For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions
given in 3GPP TR 21\.905 \[1] and the following apply. A term defined in
the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same
term, if any, in 3GPP TR 21\.905 \[1].


**Addressed area:** The multi\-train voice communication
and REC (Railway Emergency communication) are based on the concept of
predefined initiating area and predefined addressed area. Based on this
initiating area, the FRMCS system will determine a corresponding
predefined addressed area where the users are eligible to be addressed.
The eligible users will be addressed depending on their location and
functional identity. Associated to this addressed area, a list of
predefined additional users (e.g. controllers) will be also
addressed.


**Automatic Train Operation (ATO):** Automatic Train
Operation applications are responsible for acceleration to the permitted
speed, speed reduction where necessary due to speed restrictions and
stop at designated stations in the correct location.


**Automatic Train Protection (ATP):** Automatic Train
Protection applications are responsible for giving Limit of Movement
Authority to a train based on the train’s current speed, its braking
capability and the distance it can go before it must stop.


**Balise:** An electronic beacon or transponder placed
between the rails of a railway as part of an automatic train protection
or operation (ATP/ATO) system.


**Business communication applications:** communication
applications that support the railway business operation in general,
such as wireless internet, etc.


**Controller (Train Controller):** A Ground FRMCS User
provided with special capabilities by the FRMCS System.


**Driver (Train Driver):** A Mobile FRMCS User provided
with special capabilities by the FRMCS System.


**External System(s):** A general category of stationary
FRMCS Users. For example, External Systems could be systems monitoring
for trains passing a red light to initiate a railway emergency call.


**FRMCS Application:** The application on a 3GPP UE
offering railway specific communication services to the FRMCS User by
making use of the communication capabilities offered by the 3GPP UE and
the 3GPP network.


**FRMCS Equipment Identity:** The identity by which a
FRMCS equipment can be addressed.


**FRMCS Equipment Type**: Indicates the purpose the
FRMCS equipment is being used for, FRMCS equipment of different
equipment types do have different capabilities.


**FRMCS Equipment:** The FRMCS Equipment consists of a
3GPP UE and a FRMCS Application residing on it. It may be combined with
legacy railway communication equipment (e.g. GSM\-R or TRS)


**FRMCS Functional Identity:** The identity related to a
user or related to the equipment, as specified in 9\.3 "Role management
and presence" indicating its special Role (e.g. as Driver of a specific
train, usually a train number) can be addressed.


**FRMCS Network**: this is a sub\-part of the FRMCS
System.


**FRMCS Roaming**: The ability for a FRMCS User to make
use of FRMCS Applications in a Visited (FRMCS) Network.


**FRMCS System:** The system providing railway specific
communication constituted of the FRMCS Equipment, the 3GPP transport and
the application servers in the network. Legacy networks are not included
in the FRMCS System.


**FRMCS User Identity:** The identity by which a FRMCS
User can be addressed.


**FRMCS User:** A human user or a machine making use of
the railway specific communication. FRMCS Users can be connected via
3GPP RAT, wired connectivity or other radio technology


**Ground FRMCS User:** A general category of FRMCS Users
that are predominantly stationary. Mostly they are connected via wired
connectivity but may be using also wireless in certain conditions.


**Home FRMCS Network**: The Home FRMCS Network is the
network in which the FRMCS User is engaged in a subscription.


**Initiating area**: Predefined geographical area where
the initiator of a communication is located and which determines the
addressing rules used for the selection of the users to be included in

# 4 Overview


The present document is an 800 series Technical Report (TR) written
by 3GPP TSG SA WG1 (SA1\). Such a TR is not normative, i.e. cannot be
used for implementation directly and cannot be referred to by other 3GPP
specifications. It was primarily written by SA1 to summarise the
high\-level communication needs of the railway community and to identify
the corresponding requirements, which, in another step have been
introduced into normative Technical Specifications (TS) of 3GPP.


An 800 series TR will not be updated when in the process of
introduction of the requirements to TS changes are made to those
requirements, i.e. the text of the requirements listed here in this TR
will not be aligned with the requirements in the TS. Due to the fact
that most of the requirements identified in this document were
introduced in already existing Mission Critical Communication (MCX) TS,
an alignment with the MCX terminology and functionality was made
resulting in most of the requirements in here being reworded in the TS.
Also, TS requirements changes due to future work affecting requirements
stemming from this TR will not result in updates of this TR.


However, the columns “Comments” of the requirements tables listed
below were updated to indicate the disposition of the requirement in the
TS and most of the time summarising deviations and decisions taken when
introducing those requirement into normative TS. By following these
references into the normative TS the functionality provided by 3GPP for
railway communication can be derived by the reader.


FRMCS will adapt 3GPP transport to provide communication to railway
users. It eventually will resemble GSM\-R and will additionally provide
communication capabilities beyond what GSM\-R has been able to. It will
provide higher data rates, lower data latencies, multimedia
communication, and improved communication reliability. FRMCS considers
end\-to\-end use cases and also provides requirements that might or might
not be in scope of 3GPP existing specifications. To facilitate smooth
migration from legacy communication systems (e.g. GSM) to FRMCS,
interworking requirements between legacy communication systems and FRMCS
are provided.


FRMCS Equipment shall connect to application domain through 3GPP
radio access or other access. It provides emergency group communication,
low latency and high reliable data and video service in high speed train
environment. Amongst others it has the following important features:


\- Prioritized emergency group communication, train control data and
video service


\- Seamless connectivity in high speed railway moving environments


\- Low latency and high reliable data and video service


\- Real time train monitoring and management for safe train
operation


\- Reliable location tracking including in tunnel tracking


\- Legacy railway communication interworking to GSM\-R system


![](media/image3.jpeg)


Figure 4\-1: High\-level relation of FRMCS and legacy systems


Basically, railway communication services \[5] can be categorized
into


\- Train control services


\- Maintenance services


\- Railway specific services (such as Railway Emergency Call,
functional addressing, and location\-based addressing)


\- Other services (providing train crews or train Drivers with
information of train operation and interworking with the existing
railway communication systems)


This study categorizes all the use cases by considering inherent
characteristics of railway applications. Specifically, the following
categories of use cases are considered.


\- Basic functionality


\- Critical communication applications


\- Performance communication applications


\- Business communication applications


\- Critical support applications


\- Performance support applications


\- Business support applications


\- FRMCS System principles


The categories can be depicted conceptually as follows:

Critical communication applications related use cases


## 6\.1 Introduction


Critical communications applications are essential for train
movements, safety, shunting, presence, trackside maintenance, legal
aspects such as emergency communications, etc.


## 6\.2
Multi\-train voice communication for Drivers and Ground FRMCS
User(s)


### 6\.2\.1 Introduction


In this chapter the use cases related to the function of Multi\-train
voice communication from the Drivers and/or a Ground FRMCS User towards
the Driver and/or Ground FRMCS Users are defined. Ground FRMCS Users may
include Controllers. The following use cases are defined:


* Initiation of Multi\-train voice communication for Drivers and
Ground FRMCS User(s) communication
* Join a Multi\-train voice communication for Drivers and Ground
FRMCS User(s) communication
* Termination of Multi\-train voice communication for Drivers and
Ground FRMCS User(s) communication
* Interworking GSM\-R and FRMCS for Multi\-train voice communication
for Drivers and Ground FRMCS User(s) communication


NOTE 1: The assumption is that Ad hoc Group Calls are used for all
multi\-train voice communications.


* Merging of two multi\-train voice Ad hoc Group communications.
There are different use cases when merging two multi\-train voice
communications depending on the ‘merging authority’ and the initiators
of the two separate calls, as presented in the following:


* a) Two multi\-train voice communications initiated by train
drivers and merged by train controller
* b) A multi\-train voice communication initiated by train driver
and another initiated by train controller, merged by the train
controller
* c) Two multi\-train voice communications initiated by train
drivers and merged by the train driver
* d) A multi\-train voice communication initiated by train driver
and another initiated by train controller, merged by the train
driver.


Editor’s note: Merging use cases c) and d) are FFS.


### 6\.2\.2
Use case: Initiation of Multi\-train voice communication for Drivers and
Ground FRMCS User(s) communication


#### 6\.2\.2\.1 Description


A Driver and/or a Ground FRMCS User is able to initiate a voice
communication to other Drivers and/or Ground FRMCS Users.


#### 6\.2\.2\.2 Pre\-conditions


The Driver and the Ground FRMCS User are authorised to initiate the
communication. This is managed by the authorisation of communication
application.


The authorisation application authorises the Driver and the Ground
FRMCS User to use the Multi\-train voice communication for Drivers and
Ground FRMCS User(s)


#### 6\.2\.2\.3 Service flows


The Driver and/or Ground FRMCS User initiates the voice communication
to the (other) Driver(s) and/or Ground FRMCS Users. The priority of the
communication is managed by the prioritisation application. The voice
communication has the priority which matches the application category of
CRITICAL VOICE (see 12\.10\) within the FRMCS System.


The FRMCS System determines the Driver(s) and the Ground FRMCS
User(s) to be included in the communication, based on:


* location information of all users provided by the locations
services application, and/or
* functional identity of all users provided by the Role management
and presence application.
* System configuration on which Ground FRMCS User is responsible
for which part of the track/station/etc.
* System configuration related to Predefined Area Definition which
includes:


	+ Definition of initiating and addressed area
	+ Preconfigured association of Controllers to addressed
	areas


The FRMCS System establishes the voice communication within a setup
time specified as NORMAL (see 12\.10\). The information from the Role
management and presence application is used to present the identities
for both Driver(s) and Ground FRMCS User(s). The initiating Driver is
indicated to the Ground FRMCS User(s). Also the location of the
Driver(s) in the voice communication is presented to the Ground FRMCS
User(s) which is retrieved from the location services application.


If the Driver and/or Ground FRMCS User is connected to more than one
Drivers and/or Ground FRMCS Users, the multiuser talker control
application is used.


The precedence of the incoming voice communication at the Driver and
the Ground FRMCS User is managed by the prioritisation application.


The voice communication is recorded by the FRMCS System voice
recording and access application.


#### 6\.2\.2\.4 Post\-conditions


The Driver and/or the Ground FRMCS User is connected to requested
Driver(s) and/or Ground FRMCS User (s).

### 6\.2\.4
Use case: Service Interworking and service continuation between GSM\-R
and FRMCS for Multi\-train voice communication for Drivers and Ground
FRMCS User(s) communication


#### 6\.2\.4\.1 Description


For migration purposes the service interworking and service
continuation between the GSM\-R system and FRMCS System for Multi\-train
voice communication for Drivers and Ground FRMCS User(s) communication
needs to be defined.


Interworking between FRMCS and GSM\-R shall not require any changes in
the GSM\-R system.


Depending on the migration scenario a Ground FRMCS User or a Driver
can be attached to the FRMCS system, to the GSM\-R system or both. The
Driver can be attached either in the GSM\-R system or in the FRMCS
System. Functional identities are applicable in one system only.


This use case only applies to end user devices supporting both FRMCS
and GSM\-R systems, i.e. contains a FRMCS UE and a GSM\-R UE


#### 6\.2\.4\.2 Pre\-conditions


None.


#### 6\.2\.4\.3 Service flows


**Driver attached to GSM\-R**


When the Driver is attached to the GSM\-R system and is initiating
voice communication to other Drivers and Ground FRMCS User, the FRMCS
system routes the group call to the appropriate Drivers and Ground FRMCS
User(s) attached to the FRMCS.


The Multi\-train voice communication for Drivers and Ground FRMCS
User(s) communication is linked between GSM\-R and FRMCS. It is
controlled by the FRMCS system.


Service interworking between the talker control in the GSM\-R system
and the FRMCS system is not required but is expected to be done
independently in the GSM\-R and FRMCS systems.


If the Driver or the Ground FRMCS User is located in the FRMCS
System, the GSM\-R system can only route the call if it can be reached by
an address or identity understood by the GSM\-R system. The Role
management in FRMCS provides the appropriate address or identity e.g. by
providing a mapping of GSM\-R identities and FRMCS identities.


The information from the Role management and presence application is
used to route the communication and to present the identities of both
Driver and Ground FRMCS User.


**Driver attached to FRMCS**


When the Driver is attached to the FRMCS System and is initiating
voice communication to other Drivers and Ground FRMCS User(s), the FRMCS
System will route the communication through the GSM\-R to the appropriate
GSM\-R Drivers and Ground GSM\-R User(s)..


The information from the Role management and presence application is
used to route the communication and to present the identities of both
Driver and Ground FRMCS User. The Role management in FRMCS provides the
appropriate address or identity e.g. by providing a mapping of GSM\-R
identities and FRMCS identities.


**Driver moving from GSM\-R to FRMCS**


When the GSM\-R user equipment of the Driver is detached from the
GSM\-R system, the FRMCS end user device provides service continuation by
setting up the communication via the FRMCS System. An interruption of
voice communication is acceptable.


Note: It is assumed the FRMCS Application on the FRMCS Equipment will
have some control on the GSM\-R part of the UE.


**Driver moving from FRMCS to GSM\-R**


When the FRMCS User equipment of the Driver is detached from the
FRMCS System, the FRMCS end user device provides service continuation by
setting up the communication via the GSM\-R system. An interruption of
voice communication is acceptable.


Note: It is assumed the FRMCS Application on the FRMCS Equipment will
have some control on the GSM\-R part of the UE.

### 6\.2\.5
Use case: Merging of two multi\-train voice communications initiated by
Train Drivers and merged by Train Controller (Ground FRMCS user)


#### 6\.2\.5\.1 Description


The use case is derived from train Controller’s operational
activities. A Controller, as responsible for the movement of the trains
in a certain area, may be involved in more than one multi\-train
communications, impacting neighbouring areas. In that context, he/she
needs to be able to merge the two multi\-train voice communications
because there is interesting information to be shared by the two groups
participating in the two multi\-train communications. Moreover, for the
controller it is finally more convenient to handle only one
communication.


#### 6\.2\.5\.2 Pre\-conditions


All involved FRMCS users (Controller A, Driver 1, Driver 2, Driver 3,
Driver 4, Driver 5, Driver 6\) have been successfully registered to the
FRMCS Service Server and selected their functional roles.


Driver 1 is authorized to initiate a multi\-train voice
communication.


Driver 4 is authorized to initiate a multi\-train voice
communication.


Controller A is authorized to initiate a multi\-train voice
communication.


Controller A is authorized to merge two on going multi\-train
communications.


Controller A is authorized to terminate a multi\-train voice
communication.


There are two on\-going multi\-train voice communications. The
participants of each one are selected by the FRMCS Service Server, based
on the initiator’s location.


The participants of the two multi\-train voice communications belong
to the same FRMCS Service Server (same FRMCS domain).


Controller A benefits of the floor control priority (multi\-user
talker control of the FRMCS system) when involved in a multi\-train
communication.


Location information of all participants of multi\-train
communications can be provided by the FRMCS system.


The FRMCS system is preconfigured to define which controller is
responsible for each addressed area.


#### 6\.2\.5\.3 Service flows


* **1st multi\-train voice communication initiated by
Driver 1 (GC1: Group Communication1\)**


1\) Driver 1 initiates a multi\-train voice communication, with
specific criterion of initiator’s location.


2\) The FRMCS Service Server verifies if driver 1 is authorized to
initiate a multi\-train voice communication. If not authorized, the FRMCS
Service Server rejects the multi\-train voice communication initiated by
driver 1\.


3\) Based on driver’s 1 location, the FRMCS Service Server determines
the addressed area (GC1\_AdA) using the initiating area.


4\) Driver 2 and driver 3 are in the addressed area. Controller A is
responsible for this addressed area.


5\) The FRMCS Service server invites the participants fulfilling the
criterion of GC1 (GC1\_AdA), driver 2, driver 3 and controller A.
Finally, the multi\-train voice communication is established with set\-up
time specified as NORMAL (see 12\.10\).


6\) All participants’ respective floor priority is considered when
multi\-user talker control is used during the multi\-train voice
communication of this group.


* **2nd multi\-train voice communication initiated by
Driver 4 (GC2: Group Communication2\)**


1\) Driver 4 is also initiating a multi\-train voice communication with
the specific criterion of initiator’s location.


2\) Driver 4 is moving to the responsibility area of controller A


3\) The FRMCS Service Server verifies if driver 4 is authorized to
initiate a multi\-train voice communication. If not authorized, the FRMCS
Service Server rejects the multi\-train voice communication initiated by
driver 4\.


4\) Based on driver’s 4 location, the FRMCS Service Server determines
the addressed area (GC2\_AdA) using the initiating area.


5\) Driver 5 and driver 6 are in the addressed area and controller A
is responsible for this addressed area, as well.


6\) The FRMCS Service server invites the participants fulfilling the
criterion of GC2 (GC2\_AdA), driver 5, driver 6 and controller A.
Finally, the multi\-train voice communication is established with set\-up
time specified as NORMAL (see 12\.10\).


7\) All participants’ respective floor priority is considered when
multi\-user talker control is used during the multi\-train voice
communication of this group.


* **Controller A requests the FRMCS system for merging
on\-going GC1 and GC2**


1\) Controller A in now participating in two multi\-train
communications, GC1 and GC2\. From the exchanged information, controller
A realises that there is interesting information for both groups.
Moreover, the addressed areas of both communications are located close
to each other. Therefore, controller A decides to merge GC1 and GC2\.


2\) Controller A initiates a new multi\-train (merged) voice
communication, named GC3, based on a new criterion, (GC3\_AdA), which is
the union of addressed areas of GC1 (GC1\_AdA) and GC2 (GC2\_AdA), with
the updated participants of both addressed areas, at the merging time.
The participants of the merged multi\-train communications are
notified.


3\) The FRMCS Service Server verifies if controller A is authorized to
merge a multi\-train voice communication. If not authorized, the FRMCS
Service Server rejects the request for merging of multi\-train voice
communication initiated by controller A.


4\) The FRMCS Service server invites the participants fulfilling the
criterion of (GC3\_AdA), driver 1, driver 2, driver 3, driver 4, driver
5, driver 6 and controller A. Finally, the multi\-train voice
communication is established with set\-up time specified as NORMAL (see
12\.10\).


5\) The FRMCS Service server continues to check the participants that
satisfy the new criterion, corresponding to the addressed area of
(GC3\_AdA) and invites or removes FRMCS users, as usually in a
multi\-train communication based on criterion.


6\) Participants of GC1 or GC2 continue to use their respective groups
when they need to exchange information without involving the merged
group (GC3\).


#### 6\.2\.5\.4 Post\-conditions


A merged multi\-train voice communication is established, including
all participants of both multi\-train voice communications GC1 and GC2,
at the time the ‘merging’ was performed. Once the merged communication
is established, the relevant participants keep their previous floor
priorities and authorisations.

### 6\.2\.6
Use case: Merging of one multi\-train voice communications initiated by
train driver and another initiated by the train controller, merged by
the train Controller (Ground FRMCS user)


#### 6\.2\.6\.1 Description


The use case is similar to the one described in chapter §6\.2\.5 with
the main difference that one of the two initial multi\-train
communications is initiated by the train controller based on different
criterion (e.g., addressed area).


#### 6\.2\.6\.2 Pre\-conditions


All involved FRMCS users (Controller A, Driver 1, Driver 2, Driver 3,
Driver 4, Driver 5, Driver 6\) have been successfully registered to the
FRMCS Service server and selected their functional roles.


Controller A is authorized to initiate a multi\-train voice
communication.


Controller A is authorized to terminate a multi\-train voice
communication.


Driver 1 is authorized to initiate a multi\-train voice
communication.


Controller A is authorized to merge two on going multi\-train voice
communications.


There are two on\-going multi\-train voice communication. The
participants of each one are selected by the FRMCS Service server, based
on different criteria (e.g., initiator’s location for the
driver\-initiated call and addressed area for the controller\-initiated
call).


The participants of the two multi\-train voice communications belong
to the same FRMCS Service Server (same FRMCS domain).


Controller A benefits of the floor control priority (multi\-user
talker control of the FRMCS system) when involved in a multi\-train
communication.


Location information of all participants of multi\-train
communications can be provided by the FRMCS system.


The FRMCS system is preconfigured to define which controller is
responsible for each addressed area.


#### 6\.2\.6\.3 Service flows


* **1st multi\-train voice communication initiated by
Driver 1 (GC1):** The service flow is the same as described
in 6\.2\.5\.3 for the driver\-initiated call.
* **2nd multi\-train voice communication initiated by
Controller A (GC2\)**


1\) Controller A is also initiating a multi\-train voice communication
with the specific criterion of selected addressed area (GC2\_SAdA).


2\) The FRMCS Service Server verifies if controller A is authorized to
initiate a multi\-train voice communication. If not authorized, the FRMCS
Service Server rejects the multi\-train voice communication initiated by
controller A.


3\) Driver 4, driver 5 and driver 6 are moving inside the selected
addressed area


4\) The FRMCS Service server invites the participants fulfilling the
criterion of (GC2\_SAdA), driver 4, driver 5, driver 6 and controller A.
Finally, the multi\-train voice communication is established with set\-up

communication, named GC3, based on a new criterion, (GC3\_AdA), which is
the union of addressed areas of GC1 (GC1\_AdA) and GC2 (GC2\_SAdA), with
the updated participants at the merging time. The participants of the
two merged communications are informed about the merging.



> NOTE: The service flow for the controller requesting the merging of

#### 6\.2\.6\.4 Post\-conditions


A merged multi\-train voice communication is established, including
all participants of both multi\-train voice communications GC1 and GC2,
at the time the ‘merging’ was performed. Once the merged communication
is established, all the relevant participants keep their previous floor

On\-train outgoing voice communication from the Driver towards the
Controller(s) of the train


### 6\.3\.1 Introduction


In this chapter the use cases related to the function of On\-train
outgoing voice communication from the Driver towards the Controller(s)
of the train are defined. This use case allows the Driver to only
communicate with Controllers. The following use cases are defined:


* Initiation of Driver to Controller(s) voice
communication
* Termination of Driver to Controller(s) voice
communication
* Interworking GSM\-R and FRMCS of Driver to Controller(s)
communication


### 6\.3\.2
Use case: Initiation of Driver to Controller(s) voice communication


#### 6\.3\.2\.1 Description


The Driver shall be able to initiate a voice communication to the
Controller(s) that was, is, or will be responsible for the movement of
the train.


#### 6\.3\.2\.2 Pre\-conditions


The Driver is authorised to initiate the voice communication to the
Controller. This is managed by the authorisation of voice communication
application.


The Driver is authorised to use the On\-train outgoing voice
communication from the Driver towards the Controller(s) of the train
application by the application authorisation of application.


#### 6\.3\.2\.3 Service flows


**Driver to responsible Controller(s)**


The Driver initiates the voice communication to the Controller. The
priority of the communication is managed by the prioritisation
application.


The FRMCS System determines the responsible Controller(s), based
on:


* location information of the train provided by the locations
services application, and/or
* functional identity provided by the Role management and presence
application.
* system configuration on which Controller is responsible for which
part of the track/station/etc.


The FRMCS System establishes the voice communication to the
Controller(s) within a setup time specified as NORMAL (see 12\.10\). The
information from the Role management and presence application is used to
present the identities for both Driver and Controller. Also, the
location of the Driver is presented to the Controller which is retrieved
from the location services application.


If the Driver is connected to more than one Controller, the multiuser
talker control application is used.


The precedence of the incoming voice communication at the Controller
is managed by the prioritisation application.


The voice communication is recorded by the voice recording and access
application.


**Driver to another Controller(s)**


The Driver initiates the voice communication to the Controller who
was or will be responsible for the movement of the train. The addressing
is performed by selecting an entry from a list or entered manually. The
priority of the communication is managed by the prioritisation
application.


The FRMCS System presents the list of Controllers to the Driver,
based on:


* location information provided by the locations services
application, and/or
* functional identity provided by the Role management and presence
application.
* system configuration on which Controller is responsible for which
part of the track/station/etc.

### 6\.3\.4
Use case: Service Interworking and service continuation between GSM\-R
and FRMCS of Driver to Controller(s) voice communication


#### 6\.3\.4\.1 Description


For migration purposes the service interworking and service
continuation between the GSM\-R system and FRMCS System for Driver to
Controller(s) voice communication needs to be defined.


Interworking between FRMCS and GSM\-R shall not require any changes in
the GSM\-R system.


Depending on the migration scenario a Controller can be attached to
the FRMCS system, to the GSM\-R system or both. The Driver can be
attached either in the GSM\-R system or in the FRMCS System. Functional
identities are applicable in one system only.


This use case only applies to end user devices supporting both FRMCS
and GSM\-R systems.


#### 6\.3\.4\.2 Pre\-conditions


None.


#### 6\.3\.4\.3 Service flows


**Driver attached to GSM\-R**


When the Driver is attached to the GSM\-R system and is initiating
voice communication to Controller(s), the GSM\-R system will route the
voice communication to the Controller(s) accordingly.


If the Controller is located in the FRMCS System, the GSM\-R system
can only route the call to the Controller if the Controller can be
reached by an address or identity understood by the GSM\-R system. The
Role management in FRMCS provides the appropriate address or identity
e.g. by providing a mapping of GSM\-R identities and FRMCS
identities.


The information from the Role management and presence application is
used to route the communication and to present the identities of both
Driver and Controller.


**Driver attached to FRMCS**


When the Driver is attached to the FRMCS System and is initiating
voice communication to Controller(s), the FRMCS System will route the
communication to the Controller(s) accordingly. The information from the
Role management and presence application is used to route the
communication and to present the identities of both Driver and
Controller. The Role management in FRMCS shall provide the appropriate
address or identity e.g. by provide a mapping of GSM\-R identities and
FRMCS identities.


**Driver moving from GSM\-R to FRMCS**


When the GSM\-R user equipment of the Driver is detached from the
GSM\-R system the FRMCS end user device shall provide service
continuation by setting up the communication via the FRMCS System. An
interruption of voice communication is acceptable.


Note: This use case only applies to end user devices supporting both
FRMCS and GSM\-R systems, i.e. contains a FRMCS UE and a GSM\-R UE. It is
assumed the FRMCS Application on the FRMCS Equipment will have some
control of the GSM\-R part of the UE.

## 6\.4 Railway emergency
communication


### 6\.4\.1 Introduction


In this chapter the use cases related to Railway emergency
communication are defined. The following use cases are defined:


\- Initiation of the Railway emergency alert


\- New entry to the Railway emergency alert


\- Changing of the Railway emergency alert


\- Merging of Railway emergency alerts


\- Leaving of the Railway emergency alert


\- Termination of the Railway emergency alert;


\- Initiation of railway emergency voice communication


\- Termination of railway emergency voice communication


\- Initiation of Data communication during Railway emergency Alert


\- Service interworking and service continuation with GSM\-R


\- Interface to train borne recorder


### 6\.4\.2 General overview


Railway emergency communication serves two main purposes in railway
operation


\- Alert Drivers or other railway staff about an emergency. Receiving
such alert will result in immediate actions to be taken by the
recipients. These actions are defined by operational rules, e.g. a
Driver will slow down train speed to 40km/h, drive on sight, etc.


\- Based on operational rules, additional information about the
emergency can be exchanged using voice and/or data communication.


While the alert needs to be setup very fast, the information part
that may follow is less time critical and not always required. The
Railway emergency Communication consists of:


1. A mandatory alert phase indicating the emergency;
2. An optional voice and/or data communication phase depending on
operational situation and / or operational rules.



> Alert is the general term used that encompasses the different phases
> initiation, continuation and termination. This receives priority
> handling which is linked to the application category within the FRMCS
> System (see 12\.10\).


When a railway emergency alert is triggered by a FRMCS User, the
FRMCS System determines which other FRMCS Users shall receive an alert,
depending on following conditions:


\- Location, accuracy of the location, track, functional identity,
direction of movement, speed of the initiating entity


\- Location, accuracy of the location, track, functional identity,
direction of movement, speed of the FRMCS Users which are concerned of
the emergency


\- Any additional information provided by the initiating entity


By applying alert conditions, only FRMCS Users who are concerned by
this emergency will receive an alert. Figure 6\.4\.2\-1 outlines this
principle.


![](media/image5.png)


Figure 6\.4\.2\-1 Illustration of FRMCS Users in an railway emergency
alert area


Independently of any ongoing interactions between the FRMCS User and
the FRMCS Equipment, the railway emergency alert has to be continuously
indicated to the FRMCS User until the railway emergency is over (alert
is terminated).


While an alert is active, the FRMCS System shall continuously
check:


\- If additional FRMCS Users do match to the conditions of the railway
emergency alert. FRMCS User entering the emergency area/location/etc.
will receive the alert.


\- If an FRMCS User does not fulfil the conditions to be alerted
anymore, because the FRMCS User has moved away from the emergency area,
the alert will be withdrawn from this FRMCS User.


A Controller is able to change the conditions to select the
applicable FRMCS Users while an alert is active.


While an alert is active on a FRMCS Equipment, the FRMCS User is
still able to establish and / or receive other types of communication.
If a railway emergency voice communication is established by the FRMCS
User of an ongoing alert, any other ongoing voice communications are
terminated.


### 6\.4\.3 Use
case: Initiation of the railway emergency alert


#### 6\.4\.3\.1 Description


An FRMCS\- user is able to initiate a railway emergency alert. Based
on a set of conditions the FRMCS System will determine which FRMCS Users
that shall be informed about the emergency (see 6\.4\.2 General overview).
The targeted FRMCS User can be e.g. a mobile FRMCS User, a Driver, an
External System, a Controller, maintenance staff or a member of a
shunting team.


#### 6\.4\.3\.2 Pre\-conditions


The initiating FRMCS User is authorised to establish a railway
emergency alert.


#### 6\.4\.3\.3 Service flows


In any service flow, a mobile FRMCS User, e.g. a Driver, a
maintenance staff or a member of a shunting team, is not able to leave
or terminate the railway emergency alert.


**Controller initiated**


The Controller provides the conditions (e.g. train number/area/track
section/station) to the FRMCS System selecting the appropriate
recipients of the railway emergency alert. The conditions (e.g. train
number/area/track section/station) can be pre\-configured for comfortable
selection by the Controller. The Controller may need to confirm the
selection.


The FRMCS System will determine, based on the conditions, which FRMCS
Users are to receive the railway emergency alert.


The FRMCS System alerts the FRMCS Users within a setup time specified
as IMMEDIATE (see 12\.10\). The alert notification can include additional
information (e.g. text, voice prompts) which is presented to the FRMCS
User.


The priority of the railway emergency alert is managed by the
arbitration rules. The alert has the priority which matches the
application category of CRITICAL DATA (see 12\.10\) within the FRMCS
System.


In case a FRMCS User is already active in another Railway emergency
alert, the new alert is sent by the FRMCS system to the FRMCS Equipment.
The presentation of the alert(s) to the FRMCS User is managed by the
arbitration rules (out of 3GPP scope).


The Controller is informed about the alerted FRMCS Users.


The FRMCS Equipment of a Controller shows multiple alerts when
active.


The communication is recorded by the Data recording and access to
recorded data application.


**External system initiated**


FRMCS System receives the conditions from the External System (e.g. a
list/train number/area/track section/station) to address/determine the
appropriate recipients of the railway emergency alert.


The FRMCS System will determine, based on the conditions, which users
will receive the railway emergency alert.


The FRMCS System alerts the FRMCS Users within a setup time specified
as IMMEDIATE (see 12\.10\). The alert notification can include additional
information (e.g. text, voice prompts) which are presented to the FRMCS
Users.


The priority of the railway emergency alert is managed by the
arbitration rules. The alert has the priority which matches the
application category of CRITICAL DATA (see 12\.10\) within the FRMCS
System.


In case a mobile FRMCS User is already active in another Railway
emergency alert, the new alert is sent by the FRMCS system to the FRMCS
Equipment. The presentation of the alert(s) to the FRMCS User is managed
by the arbitration application (out of 3GPP scope).


The Controller is informed about the alerted FRMCS Users and the
alert initiating External System.


The FRMCS Equipment of a Controller shows multiple alerts when
active.


The communication is recorded by the Data recording and access to
recorded data application.


**Mobile FRMCS User initiated**


A FRMCS User, like a Driver, maintenance staff or a member of a
shunting team, presses the railway emergency button.


The FRMCS Equipment requests the alert communication to the FRMCS
System.


The FRMCS System determines the FRMCS Users to be included in the
railway emergency alert. This is based on the location information of
the initiator and certain conditions (e.g. functional identity, track
area, accuracy of the location, maximum track speed, station, shunting
yard, location/speed/direction of users).


The FRMCS System alerts the FRMCS\- users within a setup time
specified as IMMEDIATE (see 12\.10\). The alert notification can include
additional information (e.g. text, voice prompts) which are forwarded to
the concerned FRMCS Users.


The priority of the railway emergency alert is managed by the
prioritisation application. The alert has the priority that matches the
application category of CRITICAL DATA (see 12\.10\) within the FRMCS
System.


In case a mobile FRMCS User is already active in another Railway
emergency alert, the new alert is sent by the FRMCS system to the FRMCS
Equipment. The presentation of the alert(s) to the FRMCS User is managed
by the arbitration application (out of 3GPP scope).


The applicable Controller(s) is informed about the alerted FRMCS
Users, including which user initiated the alert.


The FRMCS Equipment of a Controller shows multiple alerts when
active.


The communication is recorded by the Data recording and access to
recorded data application.


#### 6\.4\.3\.4 Post\-conditions


The applicable FRMCS Users are alerted.

### 6\.4\.5a Use case:
Merging of Railway Emergency Alerts


#### 6\.4\.5a.1 Description


An authorized FRMCS User (i.e., Controller) or an External System
(e.g., Traffic Management System or Train Tracking System) is able to
merge two or more existing Railway Emergency Alerts. The merging may
result in changed alert conditions. The affected FRMCS Users are
notified.


#### 6\.4\.5a.2 Pre\-conditions


An FRMCS User (i.e., Controller) is authorized to merge Railway
Emergency Alerts. There are two or more ongoing Railway Emergency
Alerts. FRMCS Users involved in those alerts have been regrouped into
separate temporary groups for use during the alerts.


#### 6\.4\.5a.3 Service flows


It has been determined that the alert area must be extended to
include users involved in the ongoing alerts.


An authorized FRMCS User (i.e., Controller) or an External System is
able to provide the FRMCS System with changed alert conditions (e.g.,
extension of the area or combination of track sections) including
selection of the appropriate recipients of the new (i.e., merged)
Railway Emergency Alert. The FRMCS Users involved in the new/merged
alert are regrouped into a new temporary group.


The alert condition is declared by the Controller, or authorized
FRMCS User, on this new temporary group. The FRMCS system sends the
new/merged Railway Emergency Alert to all FRMCS Users in the new
temporary group within a setup time specified as IMMEDIATE (see 12\.10\).
The alert notification can include all relevant information including
details of the merged alerts, if needed, (e.g., text, voice prompts)
which is forwarded to and presented on the end user device of the
regrouped FRMCS Users.


The FRMCS system continuously check’s if FRMCS Users still meet the
alert conditions of the Railway Emergency Alert. The FRMCS User can be,
for example, a mobile user, a driver, maintenance staff, a member of a
shunting team or a controller.


The priority of the Railway Emergency Alert is managed by the
arbitration application. The alert has the priority which matches the
application category CRITICAL DATA (see 12\.10\).


In the case that a mobile FRMCS User is already active in a Railway
Emergency Alert, the new Railway Emergency Alert is sent by the FRMCS
System to the end user device. The presentation of the alert(s) to the
user is managed by the client arbitration application.


In case that a mobile FRMCS User is already active in an ongoing
Railway Emergency Voice and/or Data communications of another Railway
Emergency Alert (i.e., call in progress), the ongoing Railway Emergency
Voice and/or Data communications is terminated either using normal
termination condition (e.g., an authorized user terminate the call) or
using configuration parameters of the FRMCS System (e.g., timeout when
latest transmission ends).


When ongoing Railway Emergency Voice and/or Data communications of
another Railway Emergency Alert are terminated, the next request to
establish Railway Emergency Voice and/or Data communication is made on
the associated merged Railway Emergency Alert (i.e., next call occurs on
regroup group).


If a Railway Emergency Voice and/or Data communication is established
by the FRMCS User of an ongoing Railway Emergency Alert, any other
ongoing non\-emergency\-voice communications are put in the queue.


A FRMCS User \- other than the initiating FRMCS User (i.e.,
Controller) \- is not able to manually leave the temporary group of the
new Railway Emergency Alert.


The FRMCS system notifies the FRMCS Users for whom the Railway
Emergency Alert is no longer applicable and terminates the alert of
these FRMCS Users. The termination notification of the alert can include
additional information (e.g., text, voice prompts) which is presented on
the end user device of the FRMCS Users. These FRMCS Users are removed
from the merged alert temporary group.


In the case an FRMCS User no longer meets the conditions of the
Railway Emergency Alert, but there is an ongoing Railway Emergency Voice
or Data Communication, the FRMCS User will remain in the ongoing Railway
Emergency Voice or Data communication.


The initiating FRMCS User (i.e., Controller) is notified which FRMCS
Users are still part of the Railway Emergency Alert. FRMCS Users who
have left the Railway Emergency Alert are separately indicated to the
initiating FRMCS User (i.e., Controller).


The communication is recorded by the Data recording and access to
recorded data application.


#### 6\.4\.5a.4 Post\-conditions


The appropriate FRMCS Users remain in the temporary group of the
merged Railway Emergency Alert, while non\-appropriate FRMCS Users are
returned to their previous condition.


#### 6\.4\.5a.5
Potential requirements and gap analysis


### 6\.4\.6 Use case:
Leaving of the railway emergency alert


#### 6\.4\.6\.1 Description

The FRMCS System shall continuously check if FRMCS Users do match to
the conditions of the railway emergency alert.


The FRMCS System shall update the FRMCS Users for whom the railway
emergency alert is no longer valid and terminates the alert of these
FRMCS Users. The termination notification of the FRMCS System can
include additional information (e.g. text, voice prompts) which are
forwarded to the FRMCS User.


A mobile FRMCS User, e.g. a Driver, maintenance staff or a member of
a shunting team, is not able to leave or terminate the railway emergency
alert.


The priority of the railway emergency alert is managed by the
prioritisation application. The alert has the priority which matches the
application category of CRITICAL DATA (see 12\.10\) within the
FRMCS\-System


In case a FRMCS User does not match to the conditions of the railway
emergency alert and the particular FRMCS User is part of an ongoing
railway emergency voice communication, the FRMCS User will remain in the
ongoing railway emergency voice communication.


The Controller is informed by the FRMCS System about the remaining
FRMCS Users of the railway emergency alert. The applicable Controller is
updated by the FRMCS System about the particular FRMCS Users which do
not match to the conditions of the railway emergency alert.


The communication is recorded by the Data recording and access to
recorded data application.


**Controller**


An entitled Controller is able to leave the railway emergency alerts,
unless the leaving Controller is the last Controller in the alert.


The FRMCS Equipment of a Controller shows multiple alerts when

### 6\.4\.11
Use case: Service interworking and service continuation with GSM\-R


#### 6\.4\.11\.1 Description


For migration purposes, the service interworking and service
continuation between the GSM\-R system and FRMCS System for railway
emergency alerts and railway emergency voice communication needs to be
defined.


Service interworking between FRMCS and GSM\-R shall not require any
changes in the GSM\-R system specifications.


Depending on the migration scenario, a Controller can be attached to
the FRMCS System, to the GSM\-R system or both. The mobile FRMCS User can
be attached either to the GSM\-R system or to the FRMCS System.


The service continuation use cases only apply where a FRMCS Equipment
and a GSM\-R UE are linked together.


#### 6\.4\.11\.2 Pre\-conditions


None.


#### 6\.4\.11\.3 Service flows


**Mobile FRMCS User attached to GSM\-R**


When the mobile FRMCS User is attached to the GSM\-R system and is
initiating a Railway Emergency Call, the GSM\-R system, (in parallel to
processing the railway emergency call internally according to GSM\-R
definitions), routes the Railway Emergency Call to the FRMCS System,
which requires the FRMCS System to be reachable by identities that are
understood by the GSM\-R system. The FRMCS System will determine, based
on configuration, if a railway emergency alert needs to be established.
If a railway emergency alert is established a railway emergency voice
communication is initiated automatically.


The Railway Emergency Call in the GSM\-R system and the railway
emergency voice communication in the FRMCS System are linked together
and controlled by the FRMCS System.


Service interworking between the talker control in the GSM\-R system
and the FRMCS System is required, but without changing the GSM\-R
system.


When the Railway Emergency Call in the GSM\-R system is terminated,
the railway emergency alert and the railway emergency voice
communication in the FRMCS System is terminated too.


When the railway emergency voice communication in the FRMCS System is
terminated and there is a Railway Emergency Call in the GSM\-R system
linked together, Railway Emergency Call in the GSM\-R system and railway
emergency alert / the Railway emergency voice communication in the FRMCS
System are terminated too.


When the railway emergency alert in the FRMCS System is terminated
and there is a railway emergency Call in the GSM\-R system connected,
both the Railway Emergency Call in the GSM\-R system and Railway
emergency voice communication in the FRMCS System are not
terminated.


The information from the Role management and presence application is
used to forward the identities between the systems. The identity of the
initiator of the Railway Emergency Call in the GSM\-R system is made
available to the FRMCS System.


**Mobile FRMCS User attached to FRMCS**


When the FRMCS User is attached to the FRMCS System and is initiating
a railway emergency alert, and the railway emergency alert is also
relevant for the GSM\-R system based on configuration, the railway
emergency voice communication becomes initiated in the FRMCS System and
as railway emergency Call in the GSM\-R system.


The railway emergency voice communication in the FRMCS System and
Railway Emergency Call in the GSM\-R system are linked and controlled by
the FRMCS System.


Service interworking between the talker control in the FRMCS System
and the GSM\-R system is required, but without changing the GSM\-R
system.


When the railway emergency voice communication in the FRMCS System is
terminated and there is a railway emergency Call in the GSM\-R system
linked, railway emergency Call in the GSM\-R system and Railway emergency
alert / the Railway emergency voice communication in the FRMCS System
are also terminated.


When the railway emergency alert in the FRMCS System is terminated
and there is a linked Railway Emergency Call in the GSM\-R system, both
the Railway Emergency Call in the GSM\-R system and railway emergency
voice communication in the FRMCS System remain active.


When the Railway Emergency Call in the GSM\-R system is terminated,
the railway emergency alert and the railway emergency voice
communication in the FRMCS System is terminated.


The information from the Role management and presence application is
used to forward the identities between FRMCS System and GSM\-R system.
The identity of the initiator of the railway emergency alert in the
FRMCS System is made available to the GSM\-R system to be used
accordingly.


**Mobile FRMCS User moving from GSM\-R to FRMCS**


When the GSM\-R system becomes unavailable e.g. lack of coverage, the
FRMCS Equipment should provide service continuation by setting up the
communication via the FRMCS System. An interruption of voice
communication is acceptable. It is up to the end user device
implementation how this service continuation is as seamless as possible
presented to the user.


**Mobile FRMCS User moving from FRMCS to GSM\-R**


When the FRMCS radio access becomes unavailable, the FRMCS Equipment
shall able to provide service continuation by setting up the
communication via the GSM\-R system. An interruption of voice
communication is acceptable. It is up to the end user device
implementation how this service continuation is as seamless as possible
presented to the user.


Note: Both scenarios described above only apply when a FRMCS
Equipment and a GSM\-R UE are linked together. It is further assumed the
FRMCS Application on the FRMCS Equipment to have some control of the
GSM\-R UE.

## 6\.5
Use case: Automatic Train Protection (ATP) support by the FRMCS
System


### 6\.5\.1 Description


For Automatic Train Protection (ATP) the train transmits its
information (such as current location, current speed, etc.) to a radio
block centre (RBC). As soon as a connection has been established between
a train, a radio block centre and a train centre, the train sends its
position and speed information periodically. The RBC uses the received
information to decide movement authority of the train.


### 6\.5\.2 Pre\-conditions


It is assumed the current position of the train and its speed is
provided by the Location Service as defined in 9\.4\.


It is assumed that there is a bearer of suitable QoS established
between the train the radio block centre and the train control
centre.


### 6\.5\.3 Service flows


Via the bearer of suitable QoS the train provides its related
information, e.g. train number, location, to the RBC. Via this bearer
the train can request movement authority from the RBC and the RBC can
grant this to the train.

## 6\.6
Trackside Maintenance Warning System communication related use
cases


### 6\.6\.1 Introduction


Generally, trackside maintenance occur during daily train operation.
For safety reasons trackside maintenance staff need to be informed about
approaching trains entering the area of maintenance. Thus, the intention
of a trackside warning system is to inform trackside staff about the
approaching train.


Trackside warning system consists of several specific sensors and
warning entities. The sensors are responsible to detect the approaching
train and warning entities indicate trackside workers about the
approaching train. A warning entity provides this indication in form of
visual signal e.g. flashing light and an audio signal e.g. tone. In
addition, the local maintenance staff will receive the train approaching
indication on its FRMCS Equipment. When the train has left the track
section, the warning system withdraws the indication.


Sensors and warning entities constitute the warning system that
requires continuous communication between the sensors and the warning
entities. In addition, it encompasses the communication among the
warning system and the FRMCS Equipment of the local maintenance
staff.


Due to the fact that such a warning system deployment is temporary
and not always fixed network communication facilities are available at
the track, FRMCS System provides necessary mobile communication services
for the trackside warning system.


Hence this chapter describes the use cases related to Trackside
Maintenance Warning System communication. The following use cases are
identified:


* Initiation of a Trackside Maintenance Warning System
communication
* Termination of a Trackside Maintenance Warning System
communication


### 6\.6\.2
Use case: Initiation of a trackside maintenance warning system
communication


#### 6\.6\.2\.1 Description


The FRMCS User (sensors of the warning system entity) shall be able
to initiate data communication to the FRMCS Equipment of trackside
maintenance staff and/or trackside warning indication entities (FRMCS
User) in the applicable area/track.


When a train approaches that FRMCS User (FRMCS Equipment of the
trackside maintenance staff) and/or the warning indication entities of
the warning system get notified.


#### 6\.6\.2\.2 Pre\-conditions


The FRMCS Users as part of the warning system and the FRMCS Users as
part of the maintenance crew are authorised to initiate the trackside
maintenance warning system communication.


#### 6\.6\.2\.3 Service flows


The FRMCS Users (trackside maintenance warning system) and FRMCS User
(trackside workers in the applicable area) initiate the trackside
maintenance warning system communication to the receiving side.


A secure data communication application is used for the trackside
maintenance warming system communication. The communication requests the
QoS class which matches the application category of CRITICAL DATA (see
QoS section 12\.10\) within the FRMCS System.


The arbitration is managed by the arbitration application.


The communication is recorded by the Data recording application.


#### 6\.6\.2\.4 Post\-conditions


The FRMCS Users are part of the (warning system) communication are
able to exchange data.

## 6\.7 Pushed Real Time Video
streaming


### 6\.7\.1 Introduction


In this chapter the use cases related to real time video streaming
are described, the following use cases are identified


* Initiation of a real time video streaming
* Termination of a real time video streaming


### 6\.7\.2 Description


The video image quality depends on the application needs, e.g. lip
reading, pattern detection.


Video based supervision for rail operational purposes requires also
the support of Real time video capabilities from the FRMCS System.
Multiple recipients are able to use the real time video for different
purposes.


The FRMCS Users in this case are applications both onboard of the
train and on the ground, for example FRMCS Users in a train control
center.


For real time video streaming, both video and audio information are
combined.


### 6\.7\.3 Use
case: Initiation of a real time video streaming


#### 6\.7\.3\.1 Description


Video is streamed between FRMCS Users or FRMCS Equipment.


#### 6\.7\.3\.2 Pre\-conditions


The streaming FRMCS User or FRMCS Equipment has registered to a
functional identity that is authorised to initiate a real time video
stream.


Note: Successful registration of a functional identity authorised to
stream video implies the FRMCS Equipment is able to support streaming
video (e.g. camera available)


The receiving FRMCS User or FRMCS Equipment has registered to a
functional identity that is authorised to receive a real time video
stream.


Note: Successful registration of a functional identity authorised to
receive streaming video implies the FRMCS Equipment is able to support
streaming video (e.g. monitor or recording device available)


#### 6\.7\.3\.3 Service flows


The initiating FRMCS User requests a real time video streaming to
another FRMCS User.


The video streaming requests the QoS class which matches to the
application category of VIDEO or CRITICAL VIDEO within the FRMCS System,
depending on the application needs.


The video quality requested to the FRMCS System by the FRMCS User is
checked by the FRMCS Application.


If the requested quality can be reached, the FRMCS System establishes
the real time video data communication with a setup time specified as
NORMAL (see 12\.12\).


If the requested quality cannot be reached, the FRMCS Application or
the FRMCS User can decide to stop the request or to continue the setup
of video streaming with a lower video quality, depending on the
application needs.


During the real time video streaming the FRMCS Application constantly
monitors the quality. If the delivered quality of the real time video
data communication changes, the FRMCS Application or the FRMCS User is
informed about the change. The FRMCS Application or the FRMCS User may
decide to change the quality of the real time video streaming, depending
on the applications needs.


If authorized, the real time video communication is recorded by the
data recording and access to recorded data application.


The arbitration is managed by the arbitration application.


#### 6\.7\.3\.4 Post\-conditions


Depending on the QoS offered, the FRMCS Application or a FRMCS User
decide if video streaming is set up.

## 6\.8 Public emergency
call related use cases


### 6\.8\.1 Introduction


FRMCS Users have to indicate events that endanger public safety or
emergency that requires the public safety involvement. For this reason,
the FRMCS System is able to route the emergency call based on the
current position of the initiating FRMCS User. The initiation of an
emergency call has no dependency on the registration status of the FRMCS
User.


Depending on the national rules, the operator of the FRMCS System may
decide if the routing of the public emergency numbers is supported.


Following use cases related to public emergency call handling has
been identified.


* Initiation of a public emergency call
* Termination of a public emergency call

## 6\.17 On\-train
safety device to ground communication


### 6\.17\.1 Introduction


Based on a critical situation in the train (for example, triggered by
a Driver Safety Device (DSD) or Dead Man Switch, a voice and/or data
communication is automatically set up towards a ground user (controller
or ground system).


In this chapter the use cases related to On\-train safety device to
ground communication are defined. The following use case describes:


* Initiation, termination of the On\-train safety device data
communication
* Voice communication between driver/train staff and
controller/train control system


#### 6\.17\.2
Use case: Initiation of safety device to ground data communication


#### 6\.17\.2\.1 Description


1. Based on a train safety issue, the Driver Safety Device will
automatically establish a data communication to FRMCS User(s) at the
ground (controller or train management system). The functional identity
of the DSD and other FRMCS User(s) at the train are indicated to the
FRMCS User(s) at the ground.
2. On demand a voice communication can be established by the train
staff (FRMCS User) or the FRMCS User at the ground.


#### 6\.17\.2\.2 Pre\-conditions


The FRMCS User at the train is authorised to initiate Driver Safety
Device data communication.


The FRMCS User at the ground (controller or train management system)
is authorised to receive Driver Safety Device data communication.


#### 6\.17\.2\.3 Service flows


If the driver is not reacting to the DSD, the Driver Safety Device
(FRMCS User) may initiate a data communication to the FRMCS User at the
ground to notify the controller or train management system about the
safety issue of a running train.


After reception of this train safety issue, other trains in the same
area get notified by an emergency alert to lower the instantaneous
velocity of the train or stops completely.


The FRMCS User at the ground (controller or train management system)
acknowledges the reception of DSD emergency notification. The DSD
emergency notification remains active and is continuously transmitted
until the train safety has been recovered.


In addition, the entitled train staff or entitled ground staff
establishes a voice communication to commence further steps, to recover
train safety again.


#### 6\.17\.2\.4 Post\-conditions


The emergency didn’t cause a safety issue at other trains as well as
the people in those trains.

## 6\.18 Train
Integrity monitoring data communication


### 6\.18\.1 Introduction


Train integrity encompasses the continuous verification of the train
completeness, i.e. trains integrity status, for the time of mission. The
safety system on\-board the train and/or at the ground will apply the
foreseen safety reaction when the train integrity status becomes
undefined or is unknown.


Due to its safety relevance, train integrity information exchange
requires a very high reliable communication as well as very low packet
data latency.


### 6\.18\.2
Use case: Data communication for train integrity information
exchange


#### 6\.18\.2\.1 Description


The FRMCS System will be used to exchange such train integrity
information. Every train regardless the type of composition requires
this kind of data communication in a fully automated train operation
scenario.


The FRMCS Users in this case are the train integrity entities
on\-board of the train and the ground system. There several options to
determine train integrity:


1. Train integrity information will be only determined by the
applicable entities at the train. For this approach train integrity
entities are located at the front and the end of the train as well as on
demand partially between the front and the end. The front entity
supplies the train’s integrity status to the safety entity on\-board the
train responsible for Control Command Signalling. This scenario requires
Off\-network communication bearer services for multi\-user
communication.
2. Train integrity information will be determined by the applicable
entities at the train and the ground. Train integrity entities are
distributed equally over the total length of a train. The ground (train)
integrity entity will collect the reported train integrity information
and compute the train integrity status of a particular train. This
scenario requires On\-network communication bearer services.


#### 6\.18\.2\.2 Pre\-conditions


The FRMCS Users (train integrity entities) are authorised to initiate
a train integrity data communication.


The FRMCS Users (train integrity entities) are authorised to use the
train integrity application.


#### 6\.18\.2\.3 Service flows

## 6\.20 Safety related
critical advisory messaging


### 6\.20\.1 Introduction


Critical advisory information are exchanged among railway users in
order to, for example, provide safety related instructions/information
from a controller to a driver (e.g. written order, to inform about
traffic disturbances, a change in the maximum authorized speed), provide
information on how to proceed during an emergency, confirm to the
controller the readiness of the train to start, exchange information
between control centres on the traffic situation, etc.

## 6\.21 Automatic
Train Protection data communication


### 6\.21\.1 Introduction


In this chapter the use cases related Automatic Train Protection
(ATP) data communication are described, the following use cases are
identified:


* Initiation of an Automatic Train Protection data
communication
* Termination of an Automatic Train Protection data
communication
* Service interworking with GSM\-R


### 6\.21\.2 Description


Automatic Train Protection (ATP) is the application which performs
some or all the functions that ensures the safe movement of a train. ATP
supervises the train ensuring that speed and movement limits are kept
and the train proceeds only when it is allowed to do so.


Some ATP systems require radio communication to interchange safety
relevant data between a train and the corresponding control center.


The FRMCS Users in this case are the Automatic Train Protection
applications both on\-board of the train and in the control center at the
trackside (ground system).


Depending on the implementations, ATP systems require communication
between on\-board applications of different trains using On\-network
communication mode.


ATP is considered to be user\-to\-user communication. Due to safety
relevance of Automatic Train Protection (ATP), data communication
requires a non\-delay tolerant bearer service.


### 6\.21\.3
Use case: Initiation of an Automatic Train Protection data
communication


#### 6\.21\.3\.1 Description


The FRMCS Application is able to initiate data communication for
communication having continuous characteristics between the on\-board
applications and ground system and/or the on\-board applications of other
trains.


#### 6\.21\.3\.2 Pre\-conditions


The FRMCS User at the train and at the FRMCS User at ground are
authorised to initiate the Automatic Train Protection data
communication.


The receiving application is authorised to use the Automatic Train
Protection data communication.


#### 6\.21\.3\.3 Service flows


The FRMCS User (i.e. on\-board of the train or the control center at
the track side) initiates the Automatic Train Protection data
communication (i.e. control center at the trackside or on\-board the
train).


For the operation of ATP, a non\-delay tolerant bearer service is
required that corresponds to application category CRITICAL DATA/VERY
CRITICAL DATA according to QoS definition in chapter 12\.10\.


The FRMCS system takes into account the appropriate access criterion
to establish the data bearer service within a setup time specified as
IMMEDIATE (see QoS).


The arbitration among ATP and other applications applies. The
communication is recorded by the data recording application.


#### 6\.21\.3\.4 Post\-conditions


ATP related data can be exchanged between the Automatic Train
Protection communication entities.

### 6\.22\.5 Use case:
Call forwarding for Ad hoc Group Call


#### 6\.22\.5\.1 Description


The use case is based on railway operational rules, either a railway
station could temporarily be closed for any operational reasons or
operating during the night with reduced staff. In that case, railway
staff (e.g., controller) could not be joined anymore. A mechanism of
forwarding calls to railway staff located in another railway stations
shall be provided.


The use case is applicable for user\-to\-user communication (e.g.,
driver to controller) and multi\-user communication (e.g. multi\-train
voice communications involving controllers).


#### 6\.22\.5\.2 Pre\-conditions


All involved FRMCS users have selected their functional roles
(Controller A, Controller B, Driver 1, Driver 2, Driver 3\) to enable
driver\-to\-controller communication or multi\-train communications with
Drivers 1,2,3 and controller A or B, responsible for the movement of the
train.


Due to the reduced staff operating mode during the night, activities
of controller A should be handled by controller B


The FRMCS System provides a mechanism to automatically forward
communications.


Controller A is authorised to enable call forwarding.


Controller A has already configured Controller B, as destination of
his calls, in case of call forwarding activation, out of a list (e.g.
telephone book) or entered manually based on either FRMCS User Identity
or FRMCS Functional Identity. Controller B is normally operating in
another area.


Controller A is not part of an incoming communication.


#### 6\.22\.5\.3 Service flows


* **Example of night service of controller
A**


1\) During the night operation Controller A activates call forwarding
to controller B, as destination of all communications addressed to
him.


2\) Train driver 1 initiates a multi\-train voice communication, using
Ad hoc Group Call to train driver 2 and train driver 3, during the night
time, also involving controller A who is responsible for the movement of
the train. .


3\) The multi\-train voice communication is established between the
involved drivers and controller B.


4\) Controller A receives a notification that the call has been
forwarded to controller B, with the FRMCS User Identity or Functional
Identity of controller B.


* **Example of controller A not
reachable**


1\) Controller A has configured controller B, as destination of
communications addressed to him, in case of not reachable (e.g., due to
lack of coverage).


2\) Train Driver 1 is calling controller A, in a user\-to\-user voice
communication, using Ad hoc Group calls based on criteria.


3\) An Ad hoc Group call is established between driver 1 and
controller B


4\) Controller A receives a notification that the call has been
forwarded to controller B, with the FRMCS User Identity or Functional
Identity of controller B.


#### 6\.22\.5\.4 Post\-conditions


The post conditions for each scenario presented in the service flow
are:

## 6\.23 Virtual Coupling data
communication


### 6\.23\.1 Introduction


In this chapter the use cases related to Virtual Coupling data
communication are described, the following use cases are identified:


* Initiation of a Virtual Coupling data communication
* Termination of a Virtual Coupling data communication
* Service interworking with GSM\-R


### 6\.23\.2 Description


In virtual coupling use case, multiple trains can synchronously move
together as a platoon, where the distance between each train can be
shorter than the absolute braking distance.


Virtual Coupling is the application which performs some or all the
functions of, synchronous acceleration and braking, protection of
individual train within the platoon.


For trains to move synchronously, Virtual Coupling systems require
radio communication to interchange performance and/or safety relevant
data among adjacent trains in the same platoon periodically.


Due to its safety relevance, the radio communication requires very
high reliability as well as very low latency. In order to achieve high
reliability and low latency, Virtual Coupling system may use combined
On\-and Off\-network communication mode depending on the proximity.


The FRMCS users in this case are the Virtual Coupling application
on\-board of each of two trains that could potentially form a
platoon.



> NOTE: Multiple user\-to\-user communication and group communication for
> Virtual Coupling data communication are FFS


### 6\.23\.3

VERY CRITICAL DATA, the latency attributes of ULTRA\-LOW and the
reliability attributes of ULTRA\-HIGH (see 12\.10\).


The FRMCS System establishes the data bearer service(s) within the
timeframe specified as IMMEDIATE (see 12\.10\).


When Off\-network communication becomes available for the receiving
side, the initiating FRMCS user initiates the Off\-network Virtual
Coupling data communication to the receiving side.

## 6\.24 Public train
emergency communication


### 6\.24\.1 Introduction


In this chapter the following use cases related to Public train
emergency communication are considered:


\- Initiation of the Public train emergency alert


\- New entry to the Public train emergency alert


\- Changing of the Public train emergency alert


\- Merging of Public train emergency alerts


\- Leaving of the Public train emergency alert


\- Termination of the Public train emergency alert;


\- Initiation of Public train emergency voice communication


\- Termination of Public train emergency voice communication


\- Initiation of Data communication during Public train emergency
Alert


\- Service interworking and service continuation with GSM\-R


\- Interface to train borne recorder


### 6\.24\.2 General overview


The Public train emergency communication behaves as a Railway
emergency communication, but with a limited/local impact (e.g. a
platform of a level crossing). The communication can be initiated by
railway staff but also by a member of the public using a dedicated FRMCS
Equipment.


The Public train emergency alert serves the purpose of enabling the
FRMCS User to warn trains of a potentially hazardous situation. For
example, when a person fell from a platform onto the track, or when a
car is broken down on a level crossing.


When a Public train emergency alert is triggered by a FRMCS User, the
FRMCS System reacts in the same way as it would with a Railway emergency
communication only the geographical area in which users receive the
alert is generally much smaller (less users involved) than with a
Railway emergency communication: usually one or a few tracks (where a
train approaches) are involved.


In addition, the priority of the Public train emergency communication
is lower than the one of the Railway emergency communication.


The following sections capture only use cases that show deltas
compared to Railway emergency communication. For all other use cases
(listed in 6\.24\.1\), description, service flow and requirements would be
the same as the corresponding Railway emergency communication use cases,
except that they are applicable to Public train emergency
communication.


### 6\.24\.3
Use case on Initiation of the Public train emergency alert


#### 6\.24\.3\.1 Description


A FRMCS User is able to initiate the Public train emergency alert to
users that are informed about the emergency situation, e.g. that fulfil
the conditions of the emergency situation. The FRMCS User can be e.g. a
member of the public, mobile user, a driver, an external system, a
controller, maintenance staff or a member of a shunting team.


#### 6\.24\.3\.2 Service flows


**External FRMCS System initiated**


This use case is similar to Railway emergency alert, except that this
is applicable to Public train emergency alert. Please refer to
corresponding Railway emergency alert section in the current document
for relevant service flows.


**Mobile FRMCS User initiated**


This use case is similar to the Railway emergency alert, except that
this is applicable to Public train emergency alert and the FRMCS User
presses the Public train emergency activation device (not the Railway
emergency button).


Please refer to corresponding Railway emergency alert section in the
current document for relevant service flows.


#### 6\.24\.3\.3 Potential
requirements and gap analysis


Potential requirements are similar to Railway emergency communication
except the followings. Please refer to corresponding section in the
current document for relevant potential requirements and gap
analysis.

### 6\.24\.4
Use case on Initiation of Public train emergency voice
communication


#### 6\.24\.4\.1 Description


Based on operational rules, additional information about the Public
train emergency situation can be exchanged using voice communication,
e.g the initiator of the Public train emergency voice communication may
inform other involved FRMCS Users about the emergency situation.


#### 6\.24\.4\.2 Service flows


Service flows are similar to Railway emergency voice communication,
except that this is applicable to Public train emergency alert. Please
refer to corresponding section in the current document.


In addition,


* the Public train emergency voice communication is not able to
pre\-empt Railway emergency communication.
* the Railway emergency voice communication is able to pre\-empt any
other ongoing voice communication including Public train emergency
communication.


#### 6\.24\.4\.3 Potential

### 6\.24\.5
Use case on Service interworking and service continuation with GSM\-R


#### 6\.24\.5\.1 Description


The description is similar to the termination of Railway emergency
communication, except that this is applicable to Public train emergency
communication and no interworking in the direction from GSM\-R Railway
emergency call to FRMCS Public train emergency communication is
required.


Please refer to corresponding Railway emergency communication section
in the current document for relevant description.


#### 6\.24\.5\.2 Service flows


**Service flows for interworking \- Mobile FRMCS User attached
to GSM\-R**


There is no GSM\-R counterpart for the FRMCS Public train emergency
communication. No interworking in the direction from GSM\-R Railway
emergency call to FRMCS Public train emergency communication is required
since a GSM\-R Railway emergency call already initiates a FRMCS Railway
Emergency Communication.


**Service flows for interworking \- Mobile FRMCS User attached
to FRMCS**


The Service flows for interworking for a Mobile FRMCS User attached
to FRMCS is similar to the Railway emergency communication, except that
this is applicable to Public train emergency communication.


Please refer to corresponding Railway emergency communication section
in the current document for relevant description.


**Service flows for service continuation**


The Service flows for service continuation is similar to the Railway
emergency communication.

## 6\.25 Railway staff
emergency communication


### 6\.25\.1 Introduction


In this chapter the use cases related to Railway staff emergency
communication are defined. The following use cases are defined:


\- Initiation of the Railway staff emergency alert


\- New entry to the Railway staff emergency alert


\- Changing of the Railway staff emergency alert


\- Merging of Railway staff emergency alerts


\- Leaving of the Railway staff emergency alert


\- Termination of the Railway staff emergency alert;


\- Initiation of Railway staff emergency voice communication


\- Termination of Railway staff emergency voice communication


\- Initiation of Data communication during Railway staff emergency
Alert


\- Service interworking and service continuation with GSM\-R


\- Interface to train borne recorder


### 6\.25\.2 General overview


The Railway staff emergency communication is very similar to the
Railway emergency communication, but both serve two different
purposes.


The Railway emergency communication is meant to address staff of all
Railway Undertakings in a given area, whereas the Railway staff
emergency communication addresses only the users of a specific Railway
Undertaking in a given area.


Subsequently, where the Railway emergency communication has the
Infrastructure Manager’s Controller a pivotal person in the call, in the
Railway staff emergency communication, this is a Railway Undertaking’s
Operator \- usually someone that has a pivotal function in railways staff
safety and has connections to railway police or other Railway
Undertaking staff concerning safety and security.


In addition, the priority of the Railway staff emergency
communication is lower than the one of the Railway emergency
communication.


Furthermore, since the Railway staff emergency communication does not
exist in GSM\-R, no service interworking is required.


The following sections capture only use cases that show deltas
compared to Railway emergency communication. For all other use cases
(listed in 6\.25\.1\), description, service flow and requirements would be
the same as the corresponding Railway emergency communication use cases,
except that they are applicable to Railway staff emergency
communication.


### 6\.25\.3
Use case on Initiation of the railway staff emergency alert


#### 6\.25\.3\.1 Description


An FRMCS User is able to initiate the Railway staff emergency alert.
Based on a set of conditions the FRMCS System will determine which FRMCS
Users that shall be informed about the emergency.(see 6\.25\.2 General
overview). The targeted FRMCS User can be e.g., railway staff, train
staff, a train driver, an external system, a Railway staff emergency
operator or maintenance staff.


#### 6\.25\.3\.2 Service flows


In any service flow, a mobile FRMCS User, e.g., a train driver,
railway staff, train staff or maintenance staff of a specific
organisation is not able to leave or terminate the railway emergency
alert.


**Operator initiated**


Service flows are similar to Railway emergency communication, except
that the operator is not an FRMCS Operator (i.e., independent from an
administrator of the FRMCS System). Please refer to corresponding
section in the current document.


**External system initiated**


Service flows are similar to Railway emergency communication, except
that the external system is not owned and operated by an FRMCS Operator
(i.e., independent from an administrator of the FRMCS System). Please
refer to corresponding section in the current document.


**Mobile FRMCS User initiated**


Service flows are similar to Railway emergency communication, except
that the Mobile FRMCS User initiator is from a specific organisation and
can only communicate with staff from its own organisation. Criteria to
determine the FRMCS Users to be included in the Railway staff emergency
alert are similar to Railway emergency communication, limited to staff
from initiator’s organisation e.g., location and full or subparts of the
FRMCS Functional Identity of the FRMCS Users. An example of a full FRMCS
Functional Identity of an FRMCS User is a specific driver on a specific
train from a specific organisation. An example of a subpart of an FRMCS
Functional Identity of an FRMCS User is all train drivers and train
staff from the same organisation.


Please refer to corresponding section in the current document for
relevant service flows.


#### 6\.25\.3\.3 Potential
requirements and gap analysis


Potential requirements are similar to Railway emergency
communication, except the followings. Please refer to corresponding

### 7\.5\.4 Use case:
Service interworking with GSM\-R


#### 7\.5\.4\.1 Description


For coe5istence between FRMCS System and the legacy GSM\-R
communication system, service interworking among the systems is
required.


Depending on the scenario a ground FRMCS User can be attached to the
FRMCS system, to the GSM\-R system or both. The FRMCS User at the train
can be attached either to the GSM\-R system or to the FRMCS system.


This use case only applies to an FRMCS Equipment that supports FRMCS
System and GSM\-R.


#### 7\.5\.4\.2 Pre\-conditions


The FRMCS User is either attached to the FRMCS System or to
GSM\-R.


#### 7\.5\.4\.3 Service flows


**FRMCS User (Train staff) attached to
GSM\-R**


When the FRMCS User (member of the train staff) is attached to the
GSM\-R system and is initiating voice communication to FRMCS Users on the
ground, the GSM\-R system will route the voice communication to the FRMCS
User on the ground accordingly.


If the FRMCS User on the ground is registered to the FRMCS System,
the GSM\-R system establishes the communication considering the
appropriate addressing scheme.


**FRMCS User (Train staff) attached to FRMCS
System**


When the FRMCS User (member of train staff) is active in the FRMCS
system and is initiating voice communication to FRMCS Users on the
ground, the FRMCS system will establish the communication considering
the appropriate addressing schemes applicable for FRMCS System as well
as to GSM\-R accordingly.


**FRMCS User (Train staff) relocates between GSM\-R and FRMCS
System/FRMCS System and GSM\-R**


When the FRMCS User (train staff) relocates between GSM\-R \- FRMCS
System or vice versa the communication service requires continuation. An
interruption of the applicable bearer service is acceptable.


#### 7\.5\.4\.4 Post\-conditions


The communication continues if the FRMCS User at the train relocates

## 7\.7
Real\-time automatic translation of languages related use cases


### 7\.7\.1 Introduction


The language barrier is a significant obstacle to rail
interoperability. All train drivers involved in cross\-border rail
traffic must have sufficient foreign language skills to cover normal
operations, but also degraded and emergency situations e.g., traction
problems of a train, damaged switch, train driver reporting persons near
to track, etc.


Real\-time automatic translation of languages enables train drivers
and traffic controllers to communicate with one another, irrespective of
their native tongue.


Figure XXX illustrates an example of French 🡨🡪 German translation
between a French train driver and a German traffic controller when the
French train driver is moving to Germany Railways.


![](media/image7.png)


Figure 7\.7\.1\-1\. Example of French 🡨🡪 German translation between a
train driver and a traffic controller


Real\-time automatic translation of languages could be considered as a
serious game changer for rail interoperability by reducing the cost of
language training, by reducing the demands on operating personnel and
enables their more flexible assignment, by reducing stress for train
drivers when incidents, by enabling the recruitment of staff with minor
language skills, by enabling the rail traffic from being rerouted
through neighbouring countries.


NOTE: Real\-time automatic translation of languages related use cases
are limited to point\-to\-point communications between a train driver and
a traffic controller. It may be further extended in the future to other
types of communications (e.g., group communications).


### 7\.7\.2 General overview


Multiple end\-to\-end approaches for Real\-time automatic translation of
languages can be operated depending on Railway needs (Railway Operator’s
choice):


* Approach \#1: Speech to Speech (S2S) transforming the speech of
FRMCS User A to anonymous speech for FRMCS User B.
* Approach \#2: Speech to Text (S2T) transforming the speech of
FRMCS User A to text for FRMCS User B.
* Approach \#3: Text to Speech (T2S) transforming the text of FRMCS
User A to anonymous speech for FRMCS User B.
* Approach \#4: Text to Text (T2T) transforming the text of FRMCS
User A to text for FRMCS User B.


Those various approaches rely on usage of 3 modular modules as part
of the language translation tool as depicted in Figure XXX:


* Module \#1: Speech to Text (S2T) module transforming the user
speech to text format for further process of translation. This module
uses Artificial Intelligence for automatic speech recognition.
* Module \#2: Translation module ensuring the text
translation.
* Module \#3: Text to Speech (T2S) module transforming the
translated text into speech.

Figure 7\.7\.2\-1\. Modular architecture of the language translation
tool


Those modules which need extra computing and storage capacities can
be located closed to the FRMCS Users (e.g., edge computing, on\-board the
train, dispatching system) or centrally (e.g., cloud\-based) based on
implementation options.


### 7\.7\.3 Real\-time
Speech to Speech (S2S) translation


#### 7\.7\.3\.1 Description


When entering a visited Railway Operator in Country B, an FRMCS User
A (e.g., a train driver) from Country A may be able to communicate with
an FRMCS User B (e.g., traffic controller) from Country B in their
respective native tongues.


FRMCS User A is talking and listening in his own native language or
dialect used in Country A.


FRMCS User B is talking and listening in his own native language or
dialect used in Country B.


#### 7\.7\.3\.2 Pre\-conditions


The French lead driver (i.e., an FRMCS User) is authorised to
initiate point\-to\-point communications using Real\-Time Speech to Speech
translation when entering the German Railways.


The FRMCS System is aware of native language (e.g., French) of the
French lead driver (e.g., configuration attributes or pre\-selection by
the driver).


Both French lead driver and German traffic controller have selected
their roles to enable point\-to\-point communications using Real\-Time
Speech to Speech translation.


#### 7\.7\.3\.3 Service flows


When crossing the borders from France to Germany, the French lead
driver pre\-selects the destination language (e.g., German), and, as an
option, the source language (e.g., French). As an alternative, the FRMCS
System or the language translation tool automatically detects the source
language (based on e.g., speech recognition) and the destination
language (based on e.g., the location of the lead driver) to be used for
translation.


When an incident occurs, the French lead driver initiates a
point\-to\-point communication using Real\-Time Speech to Speech
translation to the German traffic controller. Once initiated, the French
lead driver orally dictates a description of the incident making use of
technical railway vocabulary in its native language.


As an option, the French lead driver may then check the displayed
translated text in French, his own language, before being sent for
translation into German to the traffic controller.


The point\-to\-point communications using Real\-Time Speech to Speech
translation are encrypted to prevent eavesdropping.


Source speech, translated text in source language, translated text in
destination language and destination speech are recorded (including
metadata e.g., timestamp, originator, receiver) in case something bad
happens and somebody wants to review the incident later.


Editor’s note: relevant metrics will be further elaborated.

link is interrupted. It is invoked on an existing voice communication
between two or more FRMCS Users.


The following use cases are defined:


\- Invocation of AVC


\- Stopping AVC


\- Degradation of a communication link (e.g. bad quality of the signal
quality or interruption of a communication link)


\- Extension of AVC


### 9\.2\.2 Use

### 9\.2\.4 Use case:
Degradation of a communication link


#### 9\.2\.4\.1 Description


Alternative 1: The FRMCS System provides a so called negative
notification to the FRMCS Users as soon as voice communication link is
interrupted.


Alternative 2: A positive notification will be given by the FRMCS
System as long as the voice communication link is unaffected.


#### 9\.2\.4\.2 Pre\-conditions


A FRMCS User is part of a voice communication with one or more FRMCS
Users.


AVC is invoked on all links of the voice communication.


#### 9\.2\.4\.3 Service flows


**Positive Notification**


The FRMCS System continuously checks whether the voice communication
links are unaffected (e.g. bad quality of the signal quality or
interruption of a communication link).


The FRMCS System indicates to all FRMCS Users involved in the voice
communication service is working properly e.g.by a periodic audio
signal.


If an interruption of at least one of the communication links is
detected, the positive notification is immediately stopped.


If AVC itself fails, the positive notification shall be stopped
immediately.


Active speech transmission shall suppress the positive notification
to all FRMCS Users involved.


Optionally all FRMCS Users have to confirm their availability
periodically (e.g. by pressing a button or by talking). If this
confirmation is not received, AVC shall be stopped immediately.


A FRMCS User terminating his participation in the voice communication
shall immediately stop AVC.


When AVC is stopped the ongoing voice communication is continued.
Assured Voice Communication may be reinvoked for the remaining FRMCS
Users of the ongoing voice communication.


**Negative Notification**


The FRMCS System continuously checks whether the voice communication
links are unaffected (e.g. bad quality of the signal quality or
interruption of a communication link).


If a degradation of a voice communication link is detected the FRMCS
System warns all involved FRMCS Users, e.g. by generating a warning
audio signal. If possible, the FRMCS User with the interrupted
communication link shall also be warned.


If AVC itself fails, the negative notification shall be given
immediately e.g. by a warning tone.


A FRMCS User terminating his participation in the voice communication
shall stop AVC and a negative notification shall be given immediately
e.g. by a warning tone.


Optionally all FRMCS Users have to confirm their availability
periodically (e.g. by pressing a button or by talking). If this
confirmation is not received, AVC shall be stopped and a negative
notification shall be given immediately e.g. by a warning tone.


When AVC is stopped the ongoing voice communication is continued.
Assured Voice Communication may be reinvoked for the remaining FRMCS
Users of the ongoing voice communication.

## 9\.3 Functional
identities and role management


### 9\.3\.1 Introduction


In this chapter the use cases related to functional identities and
role management are defined:


\- Registration to a functional identity


\- Deregistration of a functional identity


\- FRMCS User changing functional identity


\- User log\-in to the system


\- User log\-out from the system


\- Presentation of identities


\- Interrogation of identities within a certain context


Examples of Role management, like functional identities, FRMCS
Equipment Identities, etc. in the railway environment are covered by
annex A.


### 9\.3\.2 General pre\-conditions


In order to fully understand the uses cases in this chapter, Figure
9\.3\.2\-1 illustrates the different steps required to complete the
registration process.


![](media/image11.emf)


Figure 9\.3\.2\-1: Example of Role management


In this definition, it is needed to make a distinction between
different types of FRMCS Equipment. The following are, as a principle,
defined:


a) FRMCS Equipment without MMI, without the possibility to be
addressed via a functional identity related to the equipment (e.g.
sensor in the track or simple modem operation)


b) FRMCS Equipment that can be registered to a functional identity
related to the equipment (e.g. maintenance log collecting device
connected to a power station) but without other FRMCS User login


c) FRMCS Equipment that can be registered to a functional identity
and that allows a FRMCS User to login and register to functional
identities related to the user (e.g. cab radio)


d) FRMCS Equipment that cannot register to a functional identity, but
that allows a FRMS User to login and to register to functional
identities related to the user (e.g. a generic handheld device)


Steps:


1. UE\-Power on: The UE has started up and is attached to the
FRMCS network on telecoms level. The UE is reachable via its subscriber
identity address.
2. Start FRMCS Application: On the UE the FRMCS Application
start up and is ready for use.
3. FRMCS Equipment login: The FRMCS Application is logging in
into the FRMCS System and the FRMCS Equipment becomes known to the FRMCS
System.
4. Initialise FRMCS Equipment type: the type of FRMCS
Equipment used is identified.


At this stage of the user flow four different routes can be followed,
based on the determined FRMCS Equipment type of the FRMCS Equipment.


Type a) “sensor”:


* No action required. The FRMCS Equipment is now reachable via its
subscriber identity address.


After this step the process of registration is completed.


Type b) “Announcement System”:


* Register to a functional identity: the FRMCS Equipment
will request for a registration on a functional number. This functional
number is related to the equipment and identifies the device, like a PA
system on a train.
* Functional identity added: the request for a functional
identity is granted by the FRMCS System. The end user device is now
reachable via its functional identity.


After this step the process of registration is completed.


Type c) “cab radio”:


* Register to a functional identity: the FRMCS Equipment will
request for a registration on a functional identity. This functional
identity is related to the FRMCS Equipment and identifies the
environment where the equipment is used, like a cab radio in a cabin of
a train.
* Functional identity added: The FRMCS User is now only reachable
via all of its functional identities related to the FRMCS
Equipment.


Type d) “Handheld”:


Next, for both the types c) and d) the following steps apply:


* User login dialog: the user is presented with a log\-in MMI
action. The user can now login into the FRMCS System. By successfully
logging into the FRMCS System the user becomes a FRMCS User.
* FRMCS User: The FRMCS User is now reachable via its FRMCS User
Identity (and in case c) the functional identity registered by the FRMCS
Equipment).
* Register to a functional identity: the FRMCS User may request for
a registration on a functional identity. This functional identity
relates to the FRMCS User and identifies the role of the FRMCS User e.g.
driver, controller etc. and the environment e.g. train number.
* Functional identity added: The FRMCS User is now reachable via
all the functional identities registered to the user (Further, the FRMCS
Equipment is reachable via its registered functional
identity(ies).


After this step the process of registration is completed.


Note: Use cases related to power up the UE until complete
initialisation of the equipment type are covered in chapter 5\.

Functional registration of the user, the user is logged in into the
FRMCS System.


#### 9\.3\.3\.3 Service flows


**Requested functional identity is not in use**


The FRMCS User or the FRMCS\-equipment selects the functional
identity. The identity can be selected from a list based on the location
of the FRMCS User, operational schedules, etc. or the functional
identity can be entered manually.


The FRMCS User or the FRMCS\-equipment requests the FRMCS System to
register the new functional identity.


The FRMCS System informs the FRMCS User or the FRMCS\-equipment about
the outcome of the registration request.


**Requested functional identity that is in use**


The FRMCS User or the FRMCS\-equipment selects the functional
identity. The identity can be selected from a list based on the location
of the FRMCS User, operational schedules, etc. or the functional
identity can be entered manually.


The FRMCS User or the FRMCS\-equipment requests the FRMCS System to
register the new functional identity.


The FRMCS User is or the FRMCS\-equipment informed of the functional
identity already in use.


The FRMCS User or the FRMCS\-equipment shall be able to select from
the following options:


* Cancel the registration
* If the selected functional identity allows take over the
functional identity.
* If the selected functional identity allows register as an
additional FRMCS User to this functional identity.


The FRMCS System informs the FRMCS User about the outcome of the
registration request.


In the case of taking over a functional identity, the FRMCS System
deregisters the other FRMCS User or FRMCS\-equipment from this particular
functional identity. The deregistered FRMCS User or the FRMCS\-equipment
gets informed about the deregistration by the FRMCS System.


**Registration by the Railway Subsystem of the FRMCS
System**


Based on the user identification, operational conditions, like
schedules when entering the train, location, time, recent activity etc.,
the Railway Subsystem shall be able automatically register a FRMCS User
or an FRMCS Equipment to a functional identity.


The FRMCS User gets informed about the registration by the FRMCS
System.


#### 9\.3\.3\.4 Post\-conditions


In case of successful registration, the FRMCS User or the
FRMCS\-equipment can be reached based on the functional identity. The
FRMCS User or the FRMCS\-equipment can be registered to different
functional identities. The FRMCS User or the FRMCS\-equipment are also
reachable by using the FRMCS Equipment Identity, the FRMCS User Identity
(if logged in) and its subscriber identity.


In case of successful registration and based on system configuration,
the FRMCS System shall be able to notify a specific group of FRMCS
User(s) registered to functional identity(ies) with similarities in the
structure of the successfully registered functional identity.


If the FRMCS System has not accepted the registration, the FRMCS User
or the FRMCS\-equipment cannot be reached on a particular functional
identity.

### 9\.3\.4 Use
case: Deregistration of a functional identity


#### 9\.3\.4\.1 Description


A FRMCS User or the FRMCS\-equipment shall be able to deregister from
one or multiple functional identities.


#### 9\.3\.4\.2 Pre\-conditions


The FRMCS User or the FRMCS\-equipment has at least one functional
identity.


#### 9\.3\.4\.3 Service flows


**Deregistration functional identity initiated by the FRMCS
User**


The FRMCS User or the FRMCS\-equipment chooses the functional
identities to be deregistered among the list of currently registered
functional identities by:


* electing a set of functional identities (the application may
select the appropriate set of functional identities
automatically)
* selecting one functional identity


The FRMCS System informs the FRMCS User or the FRMCS\-equipment about
the outcome of the registration request.


**Deregistration by the Railway Subsystem**


Based on certain criteria the FRMCS System deregisters a FRMCS User
or the FRMCS\-equipment from one or multiple functional identities and
informs the FRMCS User or the FRMCS\-equipment about the
deregistration.


For example, possible criteria are timer, location, operational
schedules, another FRMCS User taking over the functional identity.


#### 9\.3\.4\.4 Post\-conditions


If the FRMCS System has deregistered the functional identity, the
previously registered FRMCS User (s) or FRMCS\-equipment are not any
longer reachable on this particular functional identity.


If the FRMCS System has deregistered the functional identity and
based on system configuration, the FRMCS System shall be able to notify
a specific group of FRMCS User(s) registered to functional identity(ies)
with similarities in the structure of the successfully deregistered
functional identity.


If the FRMCS System was unable to deregister the functional identity,
the actually registered FRMCS User or FRMCS\-equipment remains active and
can be reached on this functional identity.


In addition, the FRMCS User is reachable using the FRMCS Equipment
Identity, its user identity (if logged in) and its subscriber
identity.

9\.3\.9 Use case: Service interworking with GSM\-R


9\.3\.9\.1 Description


Service interworking with legacy communication systems is of
importance for the time period both systems have to coexist. In this
section service interworking between the GSM\-R System and the FRMCS
System for functional identities and its associated roles will be
addressed.


**Functional Address**


On top of the E.164 numbering plan alternative addressing scheme
called functional addressing is used in the context with GSM\-R.
Functional addressing scheme allows the establishment of communication
without knowing each E.164 number associated with a particular train. A
functional address consists of:



> IC\+CT\+UN


IC International code is used to route calls to the appropriate GSM\-R
network


CT Call Type prefix defines how to interpret the User Number (UN) as
train function number, engine function number, group calls etc.


UN User Number is of variable length and depends on the information
i.e. train function number etc. Within the UN a Functional Code (FC) is
associated and provides the information of the person or equipment on a
particular train, or a particular team within a given area. Therefore,
the UN consists of User Identification Number (UIN) i.e. train number
etc. and the Functional Code (FC) resulting into: UN\= UIN\+FC


A functional address only consists of numeric characters.


9\.3\.9\.2 Pre\-conditions


Following user addressing scenarios applies between FRMCS System and
GSM\-R system when using alternative addressing schemes in FRMCS:


A GSM\-R user is able to obtain communication services from the GSM\-R
system. E.164 numbering plan and functional addressing scheme
applies.


A FRMCS User is able to obtain communication services from the FRMCS
System or from the GSM\-R system. If the FRMCS User, in this sense the
FRMCS Equipment is registered to the FRMCS System, user addressing of
the FRMCS system applies comprising the use of functional identity
addressing scheme. If the FRMCS Equipment is registered to the GSM\-R
system, E.164 numbering plan and functional addressing i.e. IC\+CT\+UIN\+FC
scheme applies.


For a train route which encompasses both GSM\-R and FRMCS coverage
areas the functional identity registration for users and equipment
travelling this route shall be made in two parallel entries in the
respective GSM\-R functional addressing and FRMCS Functional Aliasing
databases.


Any subsequent modification of functional addressing or functional
aliasing while the user or equipment is registered shall be done in
parallel on both systems


The deregistration of the functional aliasing or functional
addressing for the user or equipment with parallel registration shall be
deregistered in parallel.


9\.3\.9\.3 Service flows


**FRMCS** U**ser relocates from GSM\-R system to
the FRMCS System**


When the FRMCS Equipment relocates from GSM\-R system to the FRMCS
System, the applicable functional address(es) associated with the FRMCS
User require(s) a conversion to the functional identity format
applicable within the FRMCS System. The functional address remains
active until the corresponding functional identity becomes
deactivated.


**FRMCS** **User relocates from FRMCS System to
the GSM\-R system**


When the FRMCS Equipment relocates from RMCS System to the GSM\-R
system, the applicable functional identity or identities associated with
FRMCS user require(s) a conversion to the functional address format
applicable within the GSM\-R system. The functional identity or
identities remains active until the corresponding functional address
becomes deactivated.


**Bilateral communication addressing between FRMCS System and
GSM\-R**


A FRMCS User establishes a communication using the functional
identity of another FRMCS User whose FRMCS Equipment is registered to
GSM\-R.


A FRMCS User establishes a communication using the functional address
of a GSM\-R user whose GSM\-R equipment is registered to GSM\-R.


A GSM\-R user establishes a communication using the functional
identity of a FRMCS User.


9\.3\.9\.4 Post\-conditions


After successful relocation following is applicable:


* From GSM\-R point of view, the FRMCS User is reachable for
communication by its functional address.
* From FRMCS System point of view, the FRMCS User is reachable for
communication by its functional identity.

## 9\.4 Location services
related use cases


### 9\.4\.1 Introduction


In this chapter the use cases related to location services are
defined. The following use cases are defined:


* Provide location information
* Request for location information
* Request for identities based on location


The location information of an FRMCS Equipment consists of the
following elements:


* Geographic Location,
* Velocity (the combination of speed and direction),
* Infra Location (additional information specifying railway infra
elements; for example: signal 123, switch 456, track section 789A,
etcetera), and
* Quality of Service information (horizontal and vertical accuracy,
response time, QoS class, accuracy of Infra Location).


### 9\.4\.2 Use Case: Provide
location information


#### 9\.4\.2\.1 Description


The FRMCS Equipment provides its location information to the FRMCS
System for further processing e.g. for automatic train operation.
External systems can be supported in providing additional location
information with or without functional identity reference to the FRMCS
System for further processing.


The location information may be shared directly with other
applications on the same FRMCS Equipment without the involvement of the
FRMCS System.


#### 9\.4\.2\.2 Pre\-conditions


The FRMCS Equipment supports some mechanisms to obtain its
location.


#### 9\.4\.2\.3 Service flows


The FRMCS Equipment determines its current location in a periodic or
an event\-triggered manner. The frequency of the location reporting may
change according to the application requirements.


The FRMCS Equipment reports location information that may include its
applicable FRMCS Equipment Identity. At any time, upon request, the
FRMCS Equipment shall be able to report its location information.


External systems can provide additional information to the FRMCS
System in order to improve location accuracy of an FRMCS Equipment.


The received location information is stored by FRMCS System.


In case of periodic location reporting, the FRMCS System supervises
the continuous supply of the location information. If the supply of
periodic location information by the FRMCS Equipment stops, the FRMCS
System initiates the re\-establishment of the periodic location
information data flow. The FRMCS System can correlate other identities
from the FRMCS Equipment Identity.


#### 9\.4\.2\.4 Post\-conditions


The location information of the FRMCS Equipment is available in the
FRMCS System.

### 9\.4\.3 Use Case:
Request for location information


#### 9\.4\.3\.1 Description


A FRMCS User, an application or an External System can request the
location information of a functional identity, FRMCS User identity or
FRMCS Equipment Identity from the FRMCS System.


#### 9\.4\.3\.2 Pre\-conditions


The FRMCS User, an application or an External System, is entitled to
request location information from the FRMCS System.


#### 9\.4\.3\.3 Service flows


A FRMCS User, an application or an External System requests location
information to the FRMCS System based on a functional identity, FRMCS
User identity or FRMCS Equipment Identity.


The location requesting entity can request for a single location
information or a periodical update of the location information.


The location requesting entity can send a request to the FRMCS System
to stop the periodical update of location information.


***Positive outcome***


The FRMCS System provides the location information as requested,
either once or periodically.


***Negative outcome***


The location information is not available, or the identity is not
known in the FRMCS System.


The FRMCS System sends a response back to the requesting FRMCS User,
application or External System if the location information is not
available.


#### 9\.4\.3\.4 Post\-conditions


The location information is provided, if available.

### 9\.5\.7 Service interworking
with GSM\-R


#### 9\.5\.7\.1 Description


For migration purposes, the service interworking between the GSM\-R
system and FRMCS system for inviting a user needs to be defined.


The following interworking use cases are needed for alerting a
controller functionality: the case that there is a group call in GSM\-R
and a user would like to invite a controller who is in FRMCS:


![](media/image12.png)


Figure 9\.5\.7\.1\-1\. Inviting\-a\-user from GSM\-R to FRMCS


The case that there is a group communication in FRMCS, and a user
would like to invite a controller who is in GSM\-R also applies:


![](media/image13.png)


Figure 9\.5\.7\.1\-2\. Inviting\-a\-user from FRMCS to GSM\-R


The above use cases only apply if the controller system is connected
to only one system. If the controller system is connected to both FRMCS
and GSM\-R systems, there is no need.


This use case only applies to end user devices supporting both FRMCS
and GSM\-R systems.


#### 9\.5\.7\.2 Pre\-condition


**Group call in GSM\-R and controller in FRMCS**

| \[R\-9\.7\.1\-003] | Multiuser Talker Control service shall be available in user\-to\-user voice communication | A | 22\.179 | 6\.7\.4 |


### 9\.7\.2 Use case:
Set the number of simultaneous talkers


#### 9\.7\.2\.1 Description


For multiuser communication, i.e. when several users are involved in
the same communication, the number of FRMCS FRMCS Users that are granted
the right to talk at the same time can be limited to either one, a
limited number or unrestricted number.


The communication application (e.g. shunting team communication) will
set the number of simultaneous talkers.


#### 9\.7\.2\.2 Pre\-conditions


An active communication application capable to use the Multiuser
Talker Control service.


#### 9\.7\.2\.3 Service flows


The communication application sends the number of simultaneous
talker(s) information to the Multiuser Talker Control service.


This information is used by Multiuser T


alker Control service when setting up the communication.


If there is a need to change the number of simultaneous talkers, it
is the communication application which sends this information to the
Multiuser Talker Control service.


If the number of simultaneous talkers is reduced and the reduction
results in having more active talkers than permitted, refer to the use
case “Grant permission to talk” (9\.7\.5\).


The Multiuser Talker Control service then uses this updated
information for controlling the number of simultaneous talkers in the
communication.


#### 9\.7\.2\.4 Post\-conditions


The Multiuser Talker Control service is aware about the number of
simultaneous FRMCS Users and uses this information during
communication.

The number of simultaneous talkers can be either one, a limited number or an unrestricted number and shall be changeable during the communication. | A | 22\.179 | R\-6\.2\.3\.7\.2\-006 |


### 9\.7\.3
Use case: Set initial talker permissions and priorities


#### 9\.7\.3\.1 Description


There are different requirements for talker permissions and to
prioritise talkers in different communication applications.


The FRMCS Users are identified by their functional identities.


The communication application defines the talker permissions and
priorities based on the functional identities and the type of
communication application, e.g., railway emergency call, shunting, multi
train.


One or multiple FRMCS Users can be granted with the permission to
perform as talker in a certain communication. These FRMCS Users are able
to request permission to talk during communication.


Certain FRMCS User (s) that have requested the permission to talk at
the same time or while another user is talking can be granted with an
initial talker permission i.e., they will be given the permission first
before requests of others are served independent of whether they were
the first requesting the permission to talk or not. This initial talker
permission granted for certain FRMCS User(s) is limited in time by
system configuration.


Different FRMCS Users can be granted with a different talker
priority. In case of parallel requests for permission to talk, the
permission is granted to the FRMCS User (s) with highest talker
priority. The requests with identical talker priorities will be queued
based on the time of request.


#### 9\.7\.3\.2 Pre\-conditions


An active communication application capable to use the multiuser
talker control.


#### 9\.7\.3\.3 Service flows


The communication application sends information about talker
permissions and talker priorities to the multiuser talker control
application.


This information is used in multiuser talker control when setting up
the communication.


If there is a need to change the information about talker permissions
and talker priorities, it is the communication application that sends
this information to multiuser talker control.


The multiuser control then uses this updated information for
controlling the talker permissions and talker priorities in the
communication.


#### 9\.7\.3\.4 Post\-conditions


The multiuser control is aware of the talker permissions and talker
priorities and uses this information for communication
control/setup.

### 9\.7\.4 Use case: Request
permission to talk


#### 9\.7\.4\.1 Description


There are occasions in the railway environment where it is needed to
mitigate the risk of miscommunication. Use cases include, for
example:


* Emergency communication
* Shunting communication
* Trackside worker communication


The system shall therefore be able to limit the number of
simultaneous talkers in a voice communication.


An entitled FRMCS User shall be able to select and de\-select FRMCS
User (s) being able to talk in a voice communication.


The FRMCS User shall be able to request the permission to talk (raise
the hand).


#### 9\.7\.4\.2 Pre\-conditions


The FRMCS User is involved in an active voice communication. The
number of simultaneous talkers is limited in this communication.


#### 9\.7\.4\.3 Service flows


The FRMCS User requests permission to talk on the MMI of the
communication application (e.g. by pressing a Push\-to\-talk button)


The communication application sends the request to the multiuser
talker control in the FRMCS System.


The communication application indicates on the MMI that talker
permission has been requested.


#### 9\.7\.4\.4 Post\-conditions


Permission to talk has been requested and a response from the
multiuser talker control in the FRMCS System expected.

### 9\.7\.5 Use case: Grant
permission to talk


#### 9\.7\.5\.1 Description


There are occasions in the railway environment where it is needed to
mitigate the risk of miscommunication. Use cases include, for
example:


* Emergency communication
* Shunting communication
* Trackside worker communication


The system shall be able to limit the number of simultaneous talkers
in a voice communication.


The list of FRMCS Users with permission to talk and those who have
requested it, shall be available to the Multiuser Talker Control
service.


#### 9\.7\.5\.2 Pre\-conditions


The FRMCS User is an active voice communication.


The Multiuser Talker Control service is configured by the
communication application to limit the number of simultaneous
talkers.


The Multiuser Talker Control service uses priorities to manage the
requests automatically


In addition, an entitled FRMCS User (i.e. based on functional
identity) who is monitoring the progress of the communication can select
and de\-select simultaneous talkers.


#### 9\.7\.5\.3 Service flows


**Automatic management of requests**


The Multiuser Talker Control service in the FRMCS System receives a
request to talk from a FRMCS User.


The Multiuser Talker Control service in the FRMCS System verifies the
number of FRMCS Users who already have permission to talk.


If the number of FRMCS Users with permission to talk does not exceed
the maximum number of simultaneous talkers, the Multiuser Talker Control
service grants automatically the permission to the requester.


If the number of FRMCS Users with permission to talk exceeds the
maximum number of simultaneous talkers, the Multiuser Talker Control
service decides based on priorities who will keep the permission to talk
and who will lose the permission to talk. The Multiuser Talker Control
service configures the system accordingly.


If the number of simultaneous talkers is reduced and the reduction
results in having more active talkers than permitted, the active talkers
immediately lose their permission to talk according to their priority
level starting with the lowest, and those remaining having the same
priority level will lose their permission to talk as soon as they stop
talking (i.e. voice detection, release PTT) until the new maximum
allowed number of talkers is met.


The initial talker is granted the permission to talk for a
configurable time (like 5 seconds).


The Multiuser Talker Control service sends an indication to the FRMCS
Users whose permission to talk has been changed due to that.


**Management of requests by an entitled FRMCS User**


The Multiuser Talker Control service in the FRMCS System receives a
request to talk from a FRMCS User.


The Multiuser Talker Control service in the FRMCS System verifies the
number of FRMCS Users who already have permission to talk.


If the number of FRMCS Users with permission to talk does not exceed
the maximum number of simultaneous talkers, the Multiuser Talker Control
service grants automatically the permission to the requester.


If the number of FRMCS Users with permission to talk exceeds the
maximum number of simultaneous talkers, the Multiuser Talker Control
service alerts the entitled FRMCS User that is monitoring the
communication, who is presented with the list of simultaneous talkers
and the list of pending requests and decides who will keep the right to
speak and who will be granted the permission to talk by selecting and
de\-selecting the corresponding FRMCS User.


The Multiuser Talker Control service configures the system
accordingly.


The Multiuser Talker Control service sends an indication to the FRMCS
Users whose permission to talk has been changed due to that.


#### 9\.7\.5\.4 Post\-conditions


Permission to talk is granted to the selected FRMCS Users.

### 9\.7\.6 Use case: Revoke
permission to talk


#### 9\.7\.6\.1 Description


There are occasions in the railway environment where it is needed to
mitigate the risk of miscommunication. Use cases include, for
example:


* Emergency communication
* Shunting communication
* Trackside worker communication


The system shall be able to limit the number of simultaneous talkers
in a voice communication.


The list of FRMCS Users with permission to talk shall be available to
the Multiuser Talker Control service.


An entitled FRMCS User who monitors the progress of the communication
shall be able at any point to revoke the permission to talk of any of
the FRMCS Users with permission to talk. Automatic revocation of talkers
in case the maximum number of simultaneous talkers has been reached and
a request to talk is received, is included in the use case above.


#### 9\.7\.6\.2 Pre\-conditions


A number of FRMCS Users are in an active voice communication for
which Multiuser Talker Control is enabled and have been granted
permission to talk.


An entitled FRMCS User is monitoring the progress of the
communication and shall be able at any point to revoke the permission to
talk of any of the FRMCS Users currently with permission to talk.


#### 9\.7\.6\.3 Service flows


The Multiuser Talker Control service presents a list of simultaneous
talkers to an entitled FRMCS User, who decides who will not keep the
right to speak by de\-selecting the corresponding FRMCS User.


The Multiuser Talker Control service configures the system
accordingly.


The Multiuser Talker Control service sends an indication to the FRMCS
Users who have modified their situation with respects to the permission
to talk.


The FRMCS User is no longer able to talk after the entitled FRMCS
User has changed the permission.


#### 9\.7\.6\.4 Post\-conditions


Permission to talk is revoked for the de\-selected FRMCS Users.

## 9\.8 Authorisation of
communication


### 9\.8\.1 Introduction


In this chapter the use cases related to authorisation of
communication are described, the following use cases are identified:


* Permit / deny communication


### 9\.8\.2 Use case: Permit /
deny communication


#### 9\.8\.2\.1 Description


The purpose of the authorisation function it to allow the network
operator to control and regulate communications in order to avoid
disruption/distraction to the users (for example Drivers during voice
communication) and preventing unauthorised communication and to minimise
network load.


The FRMCS System may therefore restrict communication based on a
configurable access matrix related to the FRMCS subscriber identity, the
FRMCS Functional Identity of the equipment, the FRMCS User Identity, the
FRMCS Functional Identity of the FRMCS Users considering the source and
destination address.


Decision to permit or deny communication is based on full or subparts
of the FRMCS Functional Identity of the FRMCS Users. An example of a
full FRMCS Functional Identity of an FRMCS User is a specific driver on
a specific train. An example of a subpart of an FRMCS Functional
Identity of an FRMCS User is all train drivers.


#### 9\.8\.2\.2 Pre\-conditions


An FRMCS User attempts to establish a communication.


#### 9\.8\.2\.3 Service flows


Upon an attempt to establish a communication, the FRMCS System checks
if the source FRMCS User address is allowed to invite the destination
FRMCS User address. The FRMCS System shall consider for the verification
process the source and destination FRMCS User address.


If multiple identities are simultaneously active to a FRMCS User, the
following order shall be applied to determine the authorisation of the
communication establishment:


* Functional identities or subparts of functional identities
related to the FRMCS User
* FRMCS User Identity
* FRMCS functional identities related to the equipment
* FRMCS subscriber identity


If the FRMCS User is allowed to establish the communication, the
FRMCS System proceeds the communication setup.


If the FRMCS User is not allowed establish the communication, the
FRMCS System shall reject the attempt including the reason of the
rejection.


#### 9\.8\.2\.4 Post\-conditions


Either the communication has been established or the FRMCS User has
been informed about the denial of the call attempt.

## 9\.9 Authorisation of
application


### 9\.9\.1 Introduction


In this chapter the use cases related to authorisation of application
are described, the following use case is identified


* Enabling/Disabling applications
* Robust mission critical group communication services
* Enabling/Disabling communication privileges per FRMCS User based
on identities/talker status


### 9\.9\.2 Use case:
Enabling/Disabling applications


#### 9\.9\.2\.1 Description


The FRMCS System shall allow the network operators to control the use
of FRMCS Applications in order to avoid disruption/distraction to the
FRMCS Users (for example Drivers), preventing unauthorised usage
according to his Role.


The FRMCS System shall therefore be able to enable / disable FRMCS
Applications for a FRMCS User depending on subscriber identity, the
functional identity of the FRMCS Equipment, the FRMCS User Identity or
the functional identity/ies of the FRMCS User. Also, context based
criteria like location and other conditions are to be taken into
account.


#### 9\.9\.2\.2 Pre\-conditions


The FRMCS User equipment is powered on and the FRMCS Application on
the FRMCS User equipment has started.


#### 9\.9\.2\.3 Service flows


**Power\-on**


After powering on the FRMCS Equipment and start of the FRMCS
Application on the FRMCS Equipment, the FRMCS System enables the FRMCS
Application(s) on the FRMCS Equipment according to the Role related to
the FRMCS subscriber identity.


**Change of registration status**


Upon a change in registration status by registration / deregistration
to / from a functional identity, change of a functional identity, user
login /logout to / from the FRMCS System, the FRMCS System enables /
disables applications.


If multiple identities are active, the following order is used to
determine the correct state:


* FRMCS functional identities related to the FRMCS User
* FRMCS User identity
* FRMCS functional Identities related to the FRMCS
Equipment
* FRMCS subscriber identity


If a FRMCS User has registered to multiple functional identities, the
FRMCS User is authorised to use all applicable FRMCS Applications
related to the different FRMCS functional identities.


If an FRMCS Application is relying on other FRMCS Applications,
enabling of all required FRMCS Applications is managed by the FRMCS
System.


Only authorised FRMCS Applications shall be presented to the FRMCS
User.


**Change of location**


If the FRMCS User enters a certain area, the FRMCS System may prevent
the use of FRMCS Application(s) which had been authorised
previously.


If the FRMCS User enters a certain area, the FRMCS System may enable
the use of FRMCS Application(s) which had not been authorised
previously.


If a FRMCS Application is relying on other FRMCS Applications,
enabling of all required FRMCS Applications is managed by the FRMCS
System.


Only authorised FRMCS Applications shall be presented to the FRMCS
User.


#### 9\.9\.2\.4 Post\-conditions


The FRMCS User has access to all authorised FRMCS Applications.

### 9\.9\.3
Use case: Robust mission critical group communication services


#### 9\.9\.3\.1 Description


For reliable railway services, conventional way is to use dualization
methodology. Most of railway services are based on on\-network
communication, which is supported by base station and core networks
under 3GPP standard. However, when disaster happens so that the
communication infrastructure is not feasible, railway service based on
the communication infrastructure cannot be maintained any more. From
3GPP Rel. 12, device\-to\-device communications has been considered to be
supported not only in the transport layer but also in the application
layer. In addition, interworking of FRMCS System with legacy systems
including GSM\-R and TRS is expected to be supported in Rel. 15\. As a
consequence, off\-network and legacy systems will become feasible for
group communication services in 3GPP technology. Therefore, by
considering not only off\-network but also legacy systems, reliability of
mission critical group communication service in the on\-network can be
enhanced. Figure 9\.9\-1 depicts a required transformation of group
communication service mode.


#### 9\.9\.3\.2 Pre\-conditions


FRMCS Equipment for train driver, customer service staff, and train
operations staff support device to device communications in the
perspective of transport layer.


FRMCS Equipment for train driver, customer service staff, and train
operations staff support on\-network, off\-network group communication
services in the perspective of applications layer.


![](media/image14.png)


Figure 9\.9\.3\.2\-1\. Transformation of group communication service
mode


#### 9\.9\.3\.3 Service Flows


1\. After initial disaster happens, emergency message (including voice
or data) delivery service based on on\-network group communication among
train driver, customer service staff, or train operations staff have
been preceded without any problem.


2\. Disaster becomes worse, and associated communication
infrastructure is destroyed and is not usable anymore.


3\. Transformation of on\-network group communication service into
off\-network or legacy network\-based group communication service is
accomplished among group members for maintaining the group communication
services even in the worse disaster.


#### 9\.9\.1\.4 Post\-conditions


Off\-network or legacy network\-based group communication among train
driver, customer service staff, or train operations staff is activated
and group communication service is maintained normally.

### 9\.9\.3a
Use case: Enabling/Disabling communication privileges per FRMCS User
based on identities/talker status


#### 9\.9\.3a.1 Description


In addition to enable the control of use of of FRMCS Applications,
the FRMCS System shall allow the network operators and/or the FRMCS
Users to control the use of FRMCS Applications with communication
privileges per FRMCS User.


FRMCS User authorization shall be based on the FRMCS User Identity
and/or the functional identity/ies of the FRMCS User, the functional
identity of the FRMCS Equipment, and/or the talker status for ongoing
communications.


Regarding this last parameter (i.e., communication privileges based
on talker status), as an example, if an FRMCS User A who is involved as
a listener in a voice communication, and FRMCS User B is talking in this
voice communication, FRMCS User A is allowed or not to put on
hold/leave/terminate the call, and/or to kick out FRMCS User B based on
talker status of both FRMCS Users A and B.


#### 9\.9\.3a.2 Pre\-conditions


The FRMCS User equipment is powered on and the FRMCS Application on
the FRMCS User equipment has started.


#### 9\.9\.3a.3 Service flows

## 9\.10 Sharing FRMCS
Equipment by FRMCS Users


### 9\.10\.1 Description


Commonly, FRMCS Users may share FRMCS Equipment, e.g. a trainborne
UE. To use the shared equipment securely, it is needed to identify the
user for the equipment.


### 9\.10\.2 Pre\-conditions


A train driver is in a train.


The train driver has an identification card.


### 9\.10\.3 Service Flows


The train driver wants to use a trainborne UE to make communication
to train control centre.


The train driver puts his/her identification card in the trainborne
UE to identify himself/herself. In this case, the identification card is
an example. It can be a type of ID number, finger\-print, etc.
instead.


The trainborne UE reads the identification information from the card
and requests authentication to FRMCS security server.


FRMCS security server confirms the information and replies the
authentication information to the trainborne UE.


FRMCS registers the train driver as the user of the trainborne UE to
relay a call for the train driver to the trainborne UE.


The trainborne UE indicates readiness to use for the train
driver.


### 9\.10\.4 Post\-conditions


The train driver makes a call to the train control centre.


The train driver receives a call using the trainborne UE that is
relayed by FRMCS.

## 9\.11 FRMCS naming authority


### 9\.11\.1 Description


The FRMCS Naming Authority (NA) is a registry service provided by
FRMCS System to facilitate the handling of various namespaces, number
spaces or other information sets needed to support FRMCS services.


For example, FRMCS User identification requires a registry to manage
the identification information which shall not be duplicated during its
registration process.


The information may contain sensitive information such as personal
information, e.g. finger\-print image. Therefore, FRMCS NA should
consider strong security mechanisms to store the information.


### 9\.11\.2 Pre\-conditions


A new train driver is registered as a new user of FRMCS.


A new trainborne UE is installed in a train.


### 9\.11\.3 Service Flows


The new train driver wants to use FRMCS System.


The train driver makes a request to register the user identification
information in FRMCS with his/her finger\-print as an identification
method.


The FRMCS checks the duplication of the user identification under the
guidance of FRMCS NA and registers the user identification information
in its registry.


During the registration, the user identification information is
handled by using a secure storage. FRMCS communicates with the secure
storage to store the information.


The train driver installs a new trainborne UE in the train. During
the installation process, the trainborne UE is registered as a new FRMCS
UE in FRMCS registry under the guidance of FRMCS NA to avoid duplication
of FRMCS UE address.


### 9\.11\.4 Post\-conditions


The train driver is registered as a new user in FRMCS System without
duplication of user identification information.


The user identification information is stored in the secure storage
safely.


The trainborne UE is installed in the train and is registered as a
new FRMCS UE in FRMCS System without duplication of UE address.

## 9\.12 Wayside\-Centric
Automatic Train Control


### 9\.12\.1 Description


Signalling block system, which is a fundamental factor in the
perspective of train control, enables the safe and efficient operation
of railways to avoid collisions between trains. The signalling block
system basically keeps a train away from entering the block occupied by
the other train. It is commonly known that moving block system compared
to fixed block system. As shown in Figure 9\.12\-1, the train in moving
block system can approach the leading train more closely.


![](media/image15.emf)


Figure 9\.12\-1 Examples of various railways block systems


One way to realize the moving block system is that a centralized
server communicates with trains and manages the moving block based on
the positions of the trains. The On\-board Automatic Train Protection
(OATP), which is on the train, report the position of the train to the
Wayside Automatic Train Protection (WATP), and the WATP decides and
provide the movement authority of the train to the OATP. The train
controls itself based on the movement authority, and trigger brake when
it approaches the border of its authorized moving area.


### 9\.12\.2 Pre\-conditions


1\. The user equipment dedicated to train control gets power\-on, and
registers to the train control system.


2\. WATPs are located in the Packet Data Network (PDN), and each train
knows the nearby WATP which can offer a movement authority and make it
move.


3\. The user equipment establishes a connection through the 3GPP
network for transporting periodical data between WATP and OATP.


### 9\.12\.3 Service flows


1\. The OATP periodically report its position to the serving WATP.


2\. The WATP periodically provide movement authority to the OATP


3\. The train accelerates, or triggers brake based on the last
received movement authority. It moves till the position that it is
authorized to move, and stops if it reaches to the border of the
authorized area.


### 9\.12\.4 Post\-conditions


The train triggers emergency brake and stops immediately if the
connection is lost and data is not received for a certain time from
WATP.

## 9\.13 Autonomous Train
Control and Operation


### 9\.13\.1 Description


In legacy train control systems, trains typically decide its movement
by interacting with trackside devices (e.g. track circuits, balise,
radio block system) or communicating with a trackside server. If a train
can autonomously figure out the positions of the nearby trains and
decide its movement authority, the transport capacity of the railway
will be enhanced. In the autonomous train control system whose service
concept is aligned to the eV2X service, trains share its position by
exchanging the information without any centralized server, and each
train decides how far it can be authorized to move based on the position
information. It is expected that main application area will be mass
transportation such as subway.


![](media/image16.emf)


Figure 9\.13\.\-1 An example of autonomous train control scenario


### 9\.13\.2 Pre\-conditions


1\. Trains know the overall schedule, and the user equipment of each
train is connected to the user equipment of the other trains operating
at the same time.


2\. A user equipment of each train is able to establish a connection
with the object Controller for the nearby point machine.


### 9\.13\.3 Service Flows


1\. A train gets started and try registration to the currently
operating trains. The registration message includes the position of the
train.


2\. The train gets the responses of the registration from the other
trains and estimates the positions of the trains.


3\. The train decides its movement authority based on the position
information and starts moving.


4\. The train positions in the corresponding areas are shared through
multicasting.


5\. Based on the periodically updated information, each train updates
its movement authority and conduct train control based on it.


6\. If needed, the train connects to the nearby point machine and
sends switch command.


### 9\.13\.4 Post\-conditions


The autonomous train control is achieved by activating movement
authority for each train or activating object Controller for nearby
point machine.

## 9\.14 Virtual Coupling


### 9\.14\.1 Description


One of the important missions that the future railway service should
achieve is to increase its transport capacity. A straight\-forward
solution is to minimize the distance between successive trains so that
train interval is reduced. It is difficult to do so in a legacy train
control system, because the successive trains need to have distance as
much as a safety margin, which should be larger than the full braking
distance.


![](media/image17.emf)


Figure 9\.14\-1 Sharing acceleration and braking control information to
shorten safety margin


This safety margin can be further shortened if the successive trains
share control information (acceleration and braking) and apply it to its
own train control. As shown in Figure 9\.14\.1, the safety margin can be
shortened if the following train immediately knows that the leading
train starts braking and also triggers braking. This is the fundamental
principle and the main purpose of virtual coupling. Figure 9\.14\.2 shows
the basic concept of the virtual coupling scenario. Multiple trains
which are in close distance move together *as they are physically
coupled*. As the distance between two trains gets smaller, the
control information of a train should be delivered to the other in
shorter time.


![](media/image18.emf)


Figure 9\.14\-2 The concept of virtual coupling scenario


### 9\.14\.2\. Pre\-conditions


1\. The leading and following trains in operation recognize each other
and have just got configured to be coupled virtually.


2\. The user equipment for train control support device to device
communications in the perspective of transport layer.


![](media/image19.emf)


Figure 9\.14\-3 Overall procedure of virtual coupling


### 9\.14\.3 Service Flows


1\. The following train begins to approach to the leading train by
exchanging the information about their position. The two trains, which
are far enough to allow a certain amount of end\-to\-end latency, are
initially connected through the 3GPP network.


2\. As the following train approaches to the leading train, they start
exchanging the information about movement control and each train then
controls itself while considering the control of the other train. The
two trains, which are still far enough to allow a certain amount of
end\-to\-end latency, keep the connection through the 3GPP network.


3\. As the following train further approaches to the leading train,
the safe braking distance gets shorter and they are required to have a
connection of which end\-to\-end latency is very short for delicate train
control. At this moment, they seamlessly switch the connection from the
3GPP network to PC5 interface


### 9\.14\.4 Post\-conditions


For safety train operation, integrity needs to be checked for train
control information delivery in the perspective of application or
transport layer. Any error on integrity check shall be immediately
reported to the train control application.

## 9\.15 Composite\-based train
operation


### 9\.15\.1 Description


This use case considers the composition and decomposition of trains
or tractions. One is the case, where two autonomous trains / traction
(train A and train B) are conducted as one composition (Train C). The
other case describes the decomposition of a train set (Train C) into

Equipment Identity management need to be provided by the FRMCS
System.


### 9\.15\.2 Pre\-conditions


Train A and Train B share information for train operation such as
position and velocity profile.


### 9\.15\.3 Service Flows


**Train composition**


1. Train/traction A and Train/traction B are autonomous trains and
moving on different tracks.
2. Train/traction A and the train/traction B are put together into
one train composition using the same railway.
3. Consequently, the different FRMCS UE identities of train/traction
A and train/traction B are changed into common FRMCS UE identity
composite train C/traction C.


**Train decomposition**


1. Train/traction C which is the composition of train/traction A and
train/traction B is moving along the railway.
2. Based on the train routing i.e. different destination of
train/traction A and train/traction B of train/traction A and
train/traction B uses two different railways.


Consequently, the FRMCS UE identity of train/traction C is decomposed
again into FRCMS UE identities of train/traction A and train/traction
B.


### 9\.15\.4 Post\-conditions


1\. Train/traction C arrives at the destination consisting of
train/traction A\&B


2\. Train A and Train B arrive at the planned destination.

Equipment, the FRMCS System automatically accepts the incoming private
or group communication to another FRMCS Equipment the FRMCS User is
logged in.


**Arbitration rules**


Arbitration rules allows configuration for automatic answering based

## 9\.17
Data communication to exchange key information for train safety
application use cases


### 9\.17\.1 Introduction


In this chapter the use cases related to Key management communication
are defined. The following use cases are defined:


* Initiation of a Key Management data communication
* Termination of a Key Management data communication
* Service interworking and service continuation with GSM\-R


### 9\.17\.2
Use case: Initiation of a Key Management data communication


#### 9\.17\.2\.1 Description


Key Management communication is the application which performs the
functions that ensure the exchange of credentials/keys required by other
applications (such as ATO, ATP) to ensure the correct authentication of
the end users of each application and the integrity of the messages
exchanged.


Some Key Management systems require radio communication to
interchange the relevant data between a train and its corresponding key
distribution centre (Key Management Center). This key distribution
centre may be located in the same network or in an external network.


The users in this case are the Key Management applications both
on\-board of the train and in the key distribution centre at the
trackside (ground system).


Key Management communication is considered to be user\-to\-user data
communication.


The communication of keys may be requested each time that an ATP or
ATO communication session is established or at any other time, depending
on the specific configuration of the Key Management application.


#### 9\.17\.2\.2 Pre\-conditions


The initiating application on the FRMCS equipment is authorised to
initiate the Key Management data communication. This is managed by the
authorisation of communication application.


The receiving application on the FRMCS equipment is authorised to use
the Key Management data communication. This is managed by the
authorisation of communication application.


#### 9\.17\.2\.3 Service flows


The initiating application on the FRMCS equipment (e.g. on\-board of
the train or the key distribution centre at the track side) initiates
the Key Management data communication to the receiving side on the FRMCS
equipment (e.g. key distribution centre at the trackside or on\-board of
the train). The QoS profile of the communication is managed by the QoS
Profile application. The data communication requests the QoS profile
which matches the application category of CRITICAL DATA (see \[QoS])
within the FRMCS system, depending on the application needs.


The FRMCS system establishes the bearer service required for the data
communication within a setup time specified as IMMEDIATE (see
\[QoS]).


The arbitration is managed by the arbitration application on the
FRMCS equipment.


The communication is recorded by the Data recording and access to
recorded data application.


#### 9\.17\.2\.4 Post\-conditions


The initiating application on the FRMCS equipment is connected to the
receiving application.


Data can be exchanged between the Key Management applications.

The FRMCS system terminates the bearer service required for the data
communication.

### 9\.17\.4
Use case: service interworking and service continuation with GSM\-R


#### 9\.17\.4\.1 Description


For migration purposes the service interworking and service
continuation between the GSM\-R system and FRMCS system for Key
Management data communication needs to be clear.


Depending on the migration scenario a key distribution centre can be
attached to the FRMCS system, to the GSM\-R system or both. The on\-board
Key Management application can be attached either in the GSM\-R system or
in the FRMCS system. Functional identities are applicable in one system
only.


This use case only applies to end user devices supporting both FRMCS
and GSM\-R systems.


Online Key Management data exchange is supported only with a packet
switched (PS) bearer in the GSM\-R system. Therefore, for service
interworking and service continuation only the PS bearer is
required.


#### 9\.17\.4\.2 Pre\-conditions


The initiating application on the FRMCS equipment is authorised to
initiate the Key Management data communication. This is managed by the
authorisation of communication application.


The receiving application on the FRMCS equipment is authorised to use
the Key Management data communication. This is managed by the
authorisation of communication application.


#### 9\.17\.4\.3 Service flows


**Initiating Key Management application attached to
GSM\-R**


When the initiating Key Management application on the FRMCS equipment
is attached to the GSM\-R system and is initiating data communication to
another Key Management application, the GSM\-R system will route the data
communication accordingly.


If the other Key Management application on the FRMCS equipment is
attached to the FRMCS system, the GSM\-R system can only route the data
communication if the destination can be reached by an address or
identity understood by the GSM\-R system. The role management in FRMCS
provides the appropriate address or identity e.g. by providing a mapping
of GSM\-R identities and FRMCS identities.


The information from the role management and presence application is
used to route the communication and to present the identities.


**Initiating Key Management application attached to
FRMCS**


When the initiating Key Management application on the FRMCS equipment
is attached to the FRMCS system and is initiating data communication to
another Key Management application, the FRMCS system will route the
communication accordingly.


If the other Key Management application on the FRMCS equipment is
attached to the GSM\-R system, the FRMCS system can only route the data
communication if the destination can be reached by an address or
identity understood by the FRMCS system. The role management in FRMCS
provides the appropriate address or identity e.g. by providing a mapping
of GSM\-R identities and FRMCS identities.


The information from the role management and presence application is
used to route the communication and to present the identities.


**Key Management application moving from GSM\-R to
FRMCS**


When the Key Management application on the FRMCS equipment is
detached from the GSM\-R system the FRMCS end user device shall provide
service continuation by setting up the communication via the FRMCS
system. An interruption of data communication is acceptable.


**Key Management application moving from FRMCS to

## 12\.9 Use case: Bearer
flexibility


### 12\.9\.1 Description


FRMCS envisages bearer flexibility to allow a certain level of
independence between Railway Applications and the underlying transport
system. FRMCS includes wireless and wireline access. It comprises
multiple access systems and shall support various voice and data
applications.


The rationale behind these requirements is that the lifecycle of
railway applications is in general much longer than the lifecycle of
telecommunication access/transport systems. Moreover, bearer flexibility
aims at improving service availability and performance.


The characteristics of bearer flexibility are:


1. A Railway Application may use one or several access systems as
appropriate.
2. Connection of FRMCS Equipment to different access systems is
dynamic (i.e. the most appropriate 3GPP or non\-3GPP access technologies
are selected automatically, potentially using multiple access
technologies for one or more Railway Applications).
3. The set of access systems chosen meets the defined QoS and the
service requirements e.g. FRMCS User mobility and connectivity which are
necessary to guarantee the functionality.
4. The introduction of a new access system should not negatively
impact existing Railway Applications.


The approach taken within FRMCS allows the integration of 3GPP and
non\-3GPP radio access evolution.


IP is used as a generic interface towards Railway Applications,
facilitating connectivity, quality of service control, security and the
separation of transport system and applications. NOTE: Non\-3GPP access
can consist of non\-terrestrial e.g. Satellite as well as of terrestrial
access systems.


### 12\.9\.2 Pre\-conditions


The Railway Adaptation Sub\-System as part of the FRMCS System is
embedded between the Railway Applications and the Multi Access Core
Network (MACN) and enables the access system independence towards those
applications. This Sub\-System adapts application characteristics to the
access systems. It manages e.g. QoS, address conversion, functional
roles and train location information.


The MACN has the ability to manage and interwork with wireless access
systems (i.e. 3GPP and non\-3GPP) as well as with wireline access
systems. It encompasses for example the management of FRMCS User
mobility, FRMCS User session/communication handling and control of
end\-to\-end communication prioritisation. The MACN interworks with legacy
communication systems and other FRMCS Systems.


The Access Control \& Management function of the FRMCS Equipment
is able to manage the different access systems as well as access via
GSM\-R (for roaming and simultaneous operation).


### 12\.9\.3 Service flows


**Case 1 (data communication)**


As an example the Automatic Train Protection (ATP) application of a
train establishes a data communication session with the applicable
ground communication entity which is connected via the fixed network
service. For ATP message exchange, the on\-board system can encompass a
railway operated private 3GPP 4G access system and a public 3GPP 5G
access system (e.g. a VPN service) as part of the FRMCS System. ATP
periodically reports train position information and receives Control
Command instructions from the ground communication entity. The FRMCS
Equipment is registered to both access systems and uses these
simultaneously if applicable.  

Simultaneous use of radio access systems may improve communication
resilience, availability, and QoS and increases bandwidth.


The concept as described here can generally be extended to other data
communication applications and (non\-)3GPP access systems.


**Case 2 (railway emergency voice communication)**The on\-board FRMCS Users are registered to the FRMCS System. An
on\-board FRMCS User establishes a Railway Emergency Communication (REC)
from a specific location in the FRMCS network. This particular
communication request takes into account the most appropriate radio
access system, for example the railway\-operated private 3GPP network.
The FRMCS System notifies the applicable users determined by the
location of the initiator of the communication by using all available
access system(s) e.g. 3GPP (public and private), WLAN or wireline. The
applicable Controller is notified via the wireline access system. The
intended recipients of the call may be using different access
systems.


The concept as described here can in general be extended to other
voice group communication applications and point to point communication
services.


**Case 3 (telemetry operation at a railway depot)**A train is located in a railway depot where only WLAN coverage
(non\-3GPP access) as part of the FRMCS System is provided. FRMCS Users
of this train are attached to the FRMCS System. An FRMCS User starts a
data session towards the applicable vehicle diagnostic entity. At that
point in time WLAN provides the radio access system for this telemetry
communication. Once the train leaves the depot and enters into a 3GPP
coverage area, the FRMCS Equipment adapts the transmission of the
telemetry data session to the most QoS effective radio access system
(3GPP access). The telemetry session continues uninterrupted when the
train changes its location.


The concept as described here can in general be extended to other
voice and data applications where other combinations of access systems
at specific locations are possible.


**Case 4 (Backup operation/resilience)**


In a certain area with dedicated 3GPP access, coverage fails. Despite
unavailability of the dedicated railway 3GPP access, FRMCS Users have
the capability to continue communications by using public 3GPP access
using an access system which may support the required or some degraded
form of QoS and which is provided in the area and which serves as a
backup or complementary system. Communication applications on trains
continue to operate, service continuity is preserved. When the
functionality of the dedicated 3GPP access system is restored, the FRMCS
Equipment resumes operation on that system.


The concept as described here can generally be extended to any
combination of access systems, e.g. WLAN and private 3GPP access.


**Case 5 (Notification of radio bearer
availability)**


In general, there is only little radio spectrum resources allocated
to railways in most regions. These should be preferably used for
operational rail communication purposes. In parallel, there are
communications that require broadband wireless communication services.
The availability of broadband wireless access can be limited e.g. to
railway stations. Thus, the FRMCS System is able to take into account
radio bearer availability at the FRMCS User’s position allowing to start
communication such as a file download/upload not harming operational
rail communication.


**Case 6 (Use of Satellite Communication)**


In some regions, trains are circulating in rural areas, on low
traffic lines. For such situation, deploying dedicated rail terrestrial
radio access is not economically viable and public mobile operator’s
service is very limited due to low population density rate. Satellite
access is foreseen as an alternative to terrestrial radio access that
reduces investment in access infrastructure. In this first approach,
satellite access is considered as an enabler to extend communication
service of rail lines with FRMCS.


Some rail applications require service continuity for railways
operation. In some situation, rail traffic is stopped when communication
services are not available. To overcome situations of temporary outage
or total destruction of terrestrial access, use of non\-terrestrial
access systems by the FRMCS system could be envisaged to deliver a
highly resilient transport service. In this second approach, satellite
access is foreseen as a backup from terrestrial radio access.


It is envisaged that the FRMCS application could be configured with
preconditions that trigger an alternate mode of operation.

## 12\.10 Use Case: QoS in a
railway environment


### 12\.10\.1 Introduction


This system principle use case provides the framework for Quality of
Service and priority level within the FRMCS System including the railway
applications. The main purpose is to specify the list of attributes
applicable to the FRMCS bearer service.


Railway applications exhibit different characteristics, e.g., in
terms of latency or reliability. On the other hand, the FRMCS System
offers bearer services with different properties.


In this context, two types of applications can be distinguished:


1. Applications that are aware of their transport service
requirements and that are able to request those from the FRMCS
System.
2. Applications that are not aware of their transport service
requirements and that are therefore not able to request those.


Railway applications require a QoS classification ranging from high
to low as low is “best effort”. The most important QoS parameters that
determine the quality of the transport system are latency of the user
data and reliability of the communication. In addition, guaranteed
bandwidth assures the continuation of critical communication.


QoS impacts train punctuality and the entire utilisation of the track
system. Therefore, the FRMCS System has to consider the various QoS
requirements.


Apart from high train speed operation, which goes up to
500kmh\-1, other fundamental factors affect wireless
communication. Railways are facing various radio signal propagation
conditions such as in free space and in tunnels. Free space encompasses
various structural and constructional scenarios. Railway corridors in
hilly terrain or forest aisle are some examples.


Radio propagation in large railway stations and shunting yards is
different from the one of the main lines. Moving trains in stations or
moving cargo wagons in shunting yards cause different propagation
conditions.


Radio tower site\-to\-site distance requires special attention. This
distance varies depending on the type of area (rural or urban) and is
determined by the boundary conditions of the RF signal (e.g. frequency
band and power budget). Railways clearly require to deploy FRMCS while
keeping the same distance between the radio towers in order to reuse the
infrastructure deployed for GSM\-R.


Voice communication is commonly used during rail operation to give
instructions to a driver of a locomotive in shunting operation, track
maintenance etc. Rail environmental conditions like slowdown or movement
of a train can impact the understandability of the voice.


Radio propagation conditions in a rail environment are quite
specific. For example train speed up to 500km/h or the insertion loss of
the radio signal into a train. Staff has to work in the train, beside a
train or under the train etc. while voice communication is ongoing. Such
conditions shall not lower the intelligibility of the voice.


Radio spectrum constraints in some regions require high efficiency in
terms of radio bandwidth utilisation where voice communication coexists
with other communication types simultaneously. The resulting voice codec
has to consider these specific conditions.


In this chapter, the use cases related to Quality of Service (QoS)
and priority are defined.


QoS and Priority includes:


* A QoS characteristics (latency, reliability, throughput, setup
time) expected from the FRMCS System in order to fulfil the required
level of communication quality
* A priority level, the priority in which the communication is
handled by the FRMCS System


The following use cases are defined:


* • Allocation of resources meeting the QoS and priority
level


• Service interworking and service continuation with GSM\-R


### 12\.10\.2
Use case: Allocation of resources meeting the QoS and priority
level


#### 12\.10\.2\.1 Description


The basis for this use case is the UIC FRMCS URS wherein
communication attributes define the QoS to be achieved for the various
kinds of railway applications. These attributes are not part of the
functional use case description but relevant for the FRMCS System and
therefore subject of this use case.


Regarding the URS communication attributes, not all attributes are
covered in the QoS use case. The following items are considered:


* Type of communication
* Latency, the delay between action and reaction
* Session Reliability
* Setup of communication, the time to establish a voice or data
communication session
* Talker assignment time in group communication
* Audio (Voice) Quality


For further details, refer to the corresponding use cases in chapters
5 – 9\. In these chapters the QoS requirements are specified on
functional level. A reference is used which refers to real values’ in
this QoS use case.


In order to be able to deliver a certain level of communication
quality, the FRMCS System enables the allocation of resources meeting a
Quality of Service (QoS) characteristics for each communication.


In order to be able to deliver a certain level of communication
precedence, the FRMCS System enables the allocation of a priority for
each communication.


The FRMCS System allows communications with a higher priority to take
precedence over communications with a lower priority and have the
ability to pre\-empt other communications.


#### 12\.10\.2\.2 Pre\-conditions


The pre\-conditions of the functional use cases out of chapter 5 – 9
are applicable.


The QoS and priority level allowed for each communication, are
predefined by the FRMCS network operator.


#### 12\.10\.2\.3 Service flows


The service flows of the functional use cases out chapter 5 – 9 are
applicable.


**Application categories**


Application categories describe the data transfer characteristic to
be achieved by a bearer service. The FRMCS System shall consider the
following user plane application categories:



> **Voice** for user to user or multiuser communication;
> Voice follows the typical conversational pattern and requires low delay
> inside the transport system;
> 
> 
> **Critical Voice** follows the voice conversational
> pattern but requires immediate session setup;
> 
> 
> **Video** used for general observations purposes, e.g.
> maintenance;
> 
> 
> **Critical Video** with indirect impact on train
> operation, e.g. passenger surveillance;
> 
> 
> **Very Critical Video** with direct impact on safety\-
> related critical train control and operation, e.g. used in driverless (
> e.g. GoA3/GoA4\) operation for automated detection of objects (no human
> in the loop) or video\-based remote control (human in the loop).
> 
> 
> **Very critical data** for future rail applications;
> 
> 
> **Critical data** follows the response pattern and
> requires high reliable transport. This category comprises future and
> legacy applications e.g. ETCS;
> 
> 
> **Non\-Critical data** used for the exchange of railway
> system or communication relevant information; requires high reliable
> transmission and preservation of the response pattern;
> 
> 
> **Messaging** for the exchange of non\-critical short
> information messages, recorded voice (for example voicemail), data,
> pictures, video; requires reliable transmission;


**Priority Level**


In order to reach the QoS applicable for each application category,
transport priority levels are required to differentiate among the
communication urgency. Priority handling of communication service
encompasses the assignment of a priority to a communication and involves
the seizing of resources, which are in use by a communication having a
lower ranking in the absence of idle resources. Priority handling
includes as well discontinuation of an ongoing communication having a
lower priority to allow an incoming communication of higher priority.
Priority handling needs to be provided to a FRMCS User for all
communications.


Priorities are treated by the FRMCS User/Equipment in the FRMCS
System based on the following conditions:


* The priority level depends on the FRMCS User initiating the
communication.
* The communication can have the priority level selected by the
FRMCS User at setup or the priority level is predefined at registration.
The treatment of priority level also applies when the FRMCS User is
registered to a visited FRMCS network.
* The definition of the priority level which may cause pre‑emption
of another ongoing communication needs to be stored and can be changed
by the FRMCS User.
* The FRMCS System is able to allocate setup classes i.e.
communication setup time requirements and resource pre\-emption
capabilities to each priority level.
* In case of resource pre‑emption, the pre‑empted FRMCS user needs
to be provided with a suitable indication.
* The priority level can be selected by the FRMCs User on a per
communication basis.


The FRMCS User may select any priority level up to the authorised
priority level. The maximum priority level needs to be stored on the
UICC. At communication setup, the FRMCS Equipment and the FRMCS System
verify the priority level at setup against the maximum authorised
priority level. If the FRMCS User has not selected a priority level at
setup, the FRMCS System applies a FRMCS User specific default priority
level. If the FRMCS User has selected at setup a priority level higher
than the maximum authorised priority level, the maximum authorised
priority level is applied for the communication.


**Service Attributes**


From FRMCS User point of view there are two main service attributes
latency and communication reliability.


For the **Latency** two classifications are
applicable:



> Low User data delay harms the functioning of the application.
> 
> 
> Normal User data delay does not harm the sequence and progress of the
> application.


From FRMCS System point of view, latency quantifies the end\-to\-end
user data transport delay between the involved communication
entities.


**Reliability** (in accordance to TS 22\.261\): in the
context of network layer packet transmissions, percentage value of the
amount of sent network layer packets successfully delivered to a given
system entity within the time constraint required by the targeted
service, divided by the total number of sent network layer packets.


Two levels are to be taken into account:



> High The packet loss at transport level is exceptional rare.
> 
> 
> Normal The packet loss at transport level is seldom.


The FRMCS System is able to assign multiple individual FRMCS User
communications having individual QoS profile to a single IP address.


To meet the different application characteristics e.g. conversational
pattern, real\-time or critical data further itemisation is necessary.
The mapping of the service attributes latency and reliability among
functional requirements and FRMCS System as well as their target values
are summarised in Table 12\.10\-1\.









| Service Attribute | FRMCS \- Functional Requirement | FRMCS – System Requirement | Service Attribute value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Latency | Low | Ultra\-Low | ≤10ms |
| Low | ≤100ms |
| Normal | Normal | ≤500ms |
| Best Effort | \>500ms |
| Reliability | High | Ultra\-High | 99\.9999% |
| High | 99\.9% |
| Normal | Normal | 99% |


Table 12\.10\-1 \- Service attribute mapping


Some application categories are time stringent e.g. critical voice or
critical data.


The range of latency and reliability requirements have a certain
dependency on the speed of the trains. In general, the requirement is
that the service attributes can be guaranteed up to 500kmh\-1.
Certain combinations of latency and reliability apply only to
**Low Speed** (≤ 40kmh\-1**).**


The applications are considered as real\-time when the FRMCS
functional requirement for the latency is specified as “Low” and “Ultra
Low”, according to table 12\.10 1\.


**Session handling**


**Setup time** of a communication session is essential
because of their safety related character. Communication session setup
encompasses the value of the elapsed time between the communication
establishment request and the indication of successful communication
session establishment. The FRMCS User requires two classes:



> **Immediate** The FRMCS User requires immediate setup of
> the communication session. The duration of the immediate communication
> session establishment shall not exceed 1 second.
> 
> 
> **Normal** Normal communication session setup time range
> does not harm the use of the application. The time duration of the
> normal communication session establishment shall not exceed 3
> seconds.


**Talker assignment time** comprises the timeframe
between talker request and the permission to talk applicable to group
communication. This timeframe shall be lower than 300ms. Talker
assignment time assumes that a group communication has been set up.


**Session Loss Rate (SLR)** indicates the number of
sessions released unintentionally per accumulated session time. SLR
shall be \<10\-2/h.


**Communication and QoS assignment**


In order to provide the required level of communication quality, the
FRMCS System will request the applicable resources as required for the
communication service from the underlying 3GPP transport system and if
appropriate also from non\-3GPP transport systems. The transport
resources are characterised by latency, reliability, guaranteed
bitrate/non\-guaranteed bitrate and communication service priority.


If no specific service attributes are required for a certain
communication service, the FRMCS System is able to apply a predefined
default.


Each communication service resource characteristic can be requested
independently of the others.


As result of the request to the underlying transport system, the
FRMCS System may offer different values than the ones requested but
which fit to the categories summarised in Table 12\.10\-1\.


The available radio spectrum in certain regions, for example in
Europe is rather limited, therefore the FRMCS System might apply
different resources for the same communication service in different
regions to achieve a radio resource efficient use of the available
bandwidth.


**Audio quality**


Voice intelligibility strongly depends on the audio bandwidth. FRMCS
System has to consider for voice communication following minimum
requirements:


* Encoding of speech encompass in minimum the range of 200–7000
Hz;
* The codec meets the local radio channel and capacity requirements
of the FRMCS system;
* The coding of speech signals is robust to radio impairments
sacrificing voice clarity;


**General functional service flows**


The QoS characteristics and priority levels allowed for each
application are predefined by the network operator.


The performance of the QoS and the priority parameters of the
corresponding communication are constantly monitored by the FRMCS
System.


The FRMCS System indicates QoS degradations to the communication
application.


When the required QoS is not achieved, the communication application
is able to:


* maintain the communication, or;
* release the communication.


#### 12\.10\.2\.4 Post\-conditions


The post conditions of the functional use cases out of chapter 5 – 9
are applicable.

## 12\.13
Use case: Provide call priority during interworking with LMR


### 12\.13\.1 Description


There are Mission Critical Services such as Railway, use many kinds
of communication technology, e.g. TRS and LTE. To make interworking
between the networks to during provide FRMCS communication, it needs to
manage call priority between calls which are made between the
networks.


During the interworking between FRMCS and LMR systems including TETRA
and P25, FRMCS provides call priority based on factors such as the
situation, group priority, level of user, etc. For example, a Railway
Emergency Call could be categorized as a public announcement on
emergency (low\-level priority) or an operation emergency call
(high\-level priority).


Examples on the priority of calls in FRMCS are provided in the
following table:


Table 12\.13\-1: Priority of calls in FRMCS








| Call Type | Priority | Related Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Operation Emergency Call | 0 (the highest) | Stop all the calls have priority lower than or equal to Control Safety Announcement |
| Control Safety Announcement (between Operation Users) | 1 | Stop all the calls have priority lower than or equal to Public Announcement on Emergency |
| Public Announcement on Emergency | 2 | Stop all the calls have priority lower than or equal to Operation Call |
| Operation Call (not emergency case) | 3 | Stop all the calls have priority lower than or equal to Service Information Announcement |
| Service Information Announcement | 4 | \- |


The examples in the table 12\.13\-1 are made by modifying of the call
priority of the railway communication system as a mission critical
service \[4].


If an operation emergency call is invoked by a user (maybe a train
driver), it should have higher level of priority than the public
announcement on emergency call of other user. In this case, all the
lower priority calls may need to be pre\-empted or queued to allow the
operation emergency call.


In order to provide the call priority, the interworking needs to be
able to maintain the information on the priority of each call and each
user who invoked a call or a group call. When a call is invoked, FRMCS
should compare the priority between the current call and the new call
and decide which one is allowed to go through.


### 12\.13\.2 Pre\-conditions


The operator at the train control centre has a Railway Emergency Call
to a train which is in operation with 500km/h speed via 3GPP
network.


Using a trainborne UE, the train driver has an announcement of
control safety to the train crews via LMR such as TRS.


### 12\.13\.3 Service flows


The operator at the train control centre calls the train driver and
the train crews to give an emergency notice via the 3GPP network of
FRMCS System.


The FRMCS System indicates the train driver and the train crews are
currently having a group call which has a lower priority then the
emergency notice call.


The FRMCS System queues the ongoing TRS call and connects the train
control centre and the trainborne UE.


The emergency notice call from the train control centre via the 3GPP
network, is relayed to TRS to make announce to the train driver and the
train crews.


The train driver and the train crews recognize the emergency and do
some proper works.


### 12\.13\.4 Post\-conditions


After the emergency notice call is ended, the queued TRS call is
resumed.

## 12\.14 Use Case: FRMCS
Positioning Accuracy


### 12\.14\.1 Introduction


This system principle use case describes the positioning accuracy
requirements to position a train, track side worker as well as other
stationary and non\-stationary object inside the track system. In
general, positioning accuracy will become a major building block to
increase the automation level of train operation. The main purpose is to
specify the accuracy parameter values.


### 12\.14\.2 Use case: FRMCS
Positioning Accuracy


#### 12\.14\.2\.1 Description


Today fixed mounted balise are used to derive the train position
inside the track\-system. This kind of train positioning is precise
enough when the train is moving. Static conditions like in stations,
push\-pull train operation or the frequent change between static and
dynamic conditions during shunting operation require hundreds of fixed
mounted balise. Thus, a balise without stationary reference shall
overcome this circumstance.


According to Figure 12\.14\-1, individual coaches, trains, track side
worker get equipped which such devices that report continuously the
process status towards the applicable control centre enriched with the
actual position information.


![](media/image21.emf)


Figure 12\.14\-1 Positioning application areas


Tracks/lines or shunting areas are subdivided into autonomous hazard
areas (red blocks see Figure 12\.14\-1\). The continuous processing of
positioning information allows the control centre to detect when hazard
areas start to overlap. Based on the computed risk integral, the control
centre is able to instruct the vehicles or trains in the concerned area
to lower the speed up to a full stop.


To guarantee fail\-safe operation in deriving the position of the
vehicle, track\-side worker etc., and independent positioning sources
need to be provided. Beside inertial navigation, GNSS and others, the
FRMCS System is required to be part of the positioning data acquisition
process. This results from rather low predictable availability of
satellite systems especially in mountain regions, multilevel railway
station as well as in tunnels. In the worst case, “rough” positioning
information only derived from the FRMCS – Land Mobile Network is
present.


The combination of 3GPP radio access network and the train on\-board
system is able to support mechanisms that can be used to locate an
entire train, stationary as well as non\-stationary objects. Together
with the positioning information of other sources (see Figure12\.14\-2\)
e.g. inertial navigation and GNSS, consolidated positioning information
of the train/object will be computed that is able to fulfil higher
accuracy of the positioning information. Train Onboard system as well as
FRMCS location information system will receive the consolidated location
positioning information for further processing by the train safety
applications and/or FRMCS location information system.


Error! Objects cannot be created from editing field codes.


Figure 12\.14\-2 Consolidation of positioning source information


The subject described is applicable to other FRMCS functional use
cases. The resulting positioning requirements in this use case are
relevant for the FRMCS System.

and station C.


FRMCS User 3 is used on a parked train in station B.


FRMCS User 4 is used by mobile warning equipment located in station
B.


Ground FRMCS User processes the received positioning information of
the different train FRMCS Users for safety purposes.

communication to the ground FRMCS User (safety application) that is
responsible for train safety purposes on the line between the stations A
and C including station B.

cases dual base stations per site can be used. The distance between
adjacent base stations various between 1 and 10km.


Train speed profile ranges between 0 \- 500km/h.


The base stations covering the line between station A and C are
enhanced cellular base stations that are able to form a carrier grade
positioning network.


#### 12\.14\.2\.3 Service flows


Train FRMCS User 1 (safety application) as part of the InterRegio
train approaches station B coming from station A.


Train FRMCS User 2 (safety application) as part of a high speed train
passes station B coming from station C.

## 12\.16 Use Case:
Interworking to external networks


### 12\.16\.1 Introduction


This section describes the general interworking between FRMCS System,
based on 3GPP transport and external communication/data networks.


12\.16\.2 Use case: FRMCS System external network interworking


12\.16\.2\.1 Description


Apart from the communication facilities within one FRMCS network,
FRMCS User(s) require as well communication facilities to and from other
external networks. Thus an FRMCS System has to provide various
communication facilities between FRMCS User(s) and external network
user(s).


The term “user” is hereby meant as either an individual or an
application.


The necessary interworking to external networks is able to provide
incoming and outgoing voice\- and data bearer services.


The following are considered as external networks:


• Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)


• Private Telephone Network


• Private Mobile Radio (PMR) or Land Mobile Radio (LMR): refer to
section 12\.6 for additional use cases to interworking between FRMCS and
LMR.


• Public Land Mobile network (PLMN)


• Other GSM\-R networks: refer to section 12\.8 for additional use
cases to interworking between FMCS and GSM\-R.


• Other FRMCS networks


• Other Wireless Access


• Other packet data networks, e.g. Internet.


#### 12\.16\.2\.2 Pre\-conditions


The FRMCS User is attached to the FRMCS System.


The external network user is attached to the external network.


Authentication and authorization of the FRMCS User(s) and
communications initiated by the FRMCS Users are managed within the FRMCS
System.


The required Quality of Service is managed by the FRMCS System.


#### 12\.16\.2\.3 Service flows


**Case 1** **(Communication is to be established
from FRMCS system towards an external network)**


An entitled FRMCS User enters a destination address for establishment
of a communication session. The destination address can be of the
following formats:


* E.164 address
* Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) (e.g. SIP address, URL, e\-mail
address…)
* EIRENE functional number
* FRMCS Functional Identity
* FRMCS User Identity
* FRMCS subscriber identity


Based on the destination address, the FRMCS System performs the
following:


* Detects the correct bearer type including
characteristics
* Translates the destination address to a routable format
* Analyses if the destination is external to FRMCS System
* Selects an available interconnection for the bearer type.
(Interconnection selection can be either a direct or indirect
connection, e.g. gateway)
* Attempts to setup the communication session


**Case2 (Communication is to be established from an external
network towards FRMCS system)**


An external network user tries to establish a communication session
towards an FRMCS User. The destination address can be of the following
formats, depending of the capabilities of the external network:


* E.164 address
* Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) (e g SIP address, URL, e\-mail
address…)
* FRMCS Functional Identity (other FRMCS networks)
* FRMCS User Identity (other FRMCS networks)
* FRMCS subscriber identity (other FRMCS networks)


Based on the destination address, the FRMCS System does the
following:


* Locates user(s) within the FRMCS System to detect possible
roaming case
* Translates the destination address into a routable
format
* Detects the correct bearer characteristics
* Establishes the communication session.


#### 12\.16\.2\.4 Post\-conditions


**Case1**


An FRMCS User is able to establish voice and/or data communication
with intended user(s) in an external network.


**Case2**


An external network user is able to establish voice and/or data
communication with intended user(s) managed by the FRMCS System.

## 12\.17 Use
Case: FRMCS On\-network/Off\-network communication


### 12\.17\.1 Introduction


Typical communication will involve the transport capabilities of the
FRMCS network but some of the FRMCS communication scenarios require the
use of Off\-network bearer services. Also a combination of On\-network and
Off\-network bearer services can increase the entire availability of the
entire FRMCS transport system which is essential for railways especially
in Automated Train Operation.


This results into three global FRMCS communications modes:


• On\-network only communication


• Off\-network only communication


• Combined On\-network and Off\-network communication.


Note: The different types of communication use cases related to
On\-network and/or Off\-network are summarised in Annex C.


### 12\.17\.2 Use case:
On\-network/Off\-network communication


#### 12\.17\.2\.1 Description


**On\-network** only communication mode uses the bearer
services that are provided by the FRMCS land mobile network. It relies
on the flexible use of 3GPP and non 3GPP bearer services and allows user
to user as well as multi\-user communication.


![](media/image22.emf)


**Figure 12\.17\-1 FRMCS On\-network communication
mode**


On\-network communication is used for Mobile FRMCS User (onboard) to
Ground FRMCS User (controller) communication.


**Off\-network** only communication mode uses a dedicated
radio bearer service for proximity communication which is supported by
FRMCS Equipment. It relies on an appropriate 3GPP bearer service that
allows user to user as well as multi\-user communication without direct
involvement of FRMCS land mobile network. A relay function in
Off\-network communication mode can extend the range of the communication
facilities. FRMCS Equipment may bridge a distance for proximity
communications of up to 3km.


![](media/image23.emf)


**Figure 12\.17\-2: FRMCS Off\-network communication
mode**


Off\-network communication can be used for e.g. shunting or banking
communication where not always a ground FRMCS User i.e. controller is
necessary. Off\-network communication provides also the backup if
On\-network communication is unavailable.


**Combined On\-and Off\-network** communication mode
encompasses the parallel use of the FRMCS land mobile network and the
radio bearer service for proximity communication. There are various
sub\-categories for this communication mode:



> **Relay mode 1:** A FRMCS Equipment uses On\-network and
> Off\-network communication and constitutes an On\- and Off\-network relay
> function to other FRMCS Equipment’s that are in Off\-network only
> communication mode.


![](media/image24.emf)


**Figure 12\.17\-3: FRMCS On\-network and Off\-network
communication mode \- Relay mode 1**



> On\-network and off network communication mode relay mode 1 bridge
> over the coupling loss for FRMCS Users in a train that do not have
> access to the roof antenna. Hence, relay mode 1 helps to overcome radio
> link issues in a train.
> 
> 
> **Relay mode 2:** FRMCS equipment encompasses On\-network
> and Off\-network communication that enables Off\-network bearer service
> for an Off\-network only communication relay function.


![](media/image25.emf)


**Figure 12\.17\- 4: FRMCS On\-network/Off\-network communication
mode \- Relay mode 2**



> Relay mode 2 is an extension of relay mode 1 that allows e.g. the
> concatenation of maintenance teams during tunnel maintenance
> activities.
> 
> 
> **Relay mode 3:** FRMCS Equipment encompasses On\-network
> and Off\-network communication. Each FRMCS Equipment is able to
> constitute an On\-network and Off\-network relay function. Interworking
> between one and several of such relay functions allows the use of
> multipath transport facilities for communication purposes.


![](media/image26.emf)


**Figure 12\.17\-5: FRMCS On\-network\-and Off\-network
communication mode \- Relay mode 3**



> Relay mode 3 allows multipath transport facilities for FRMCS
> Applications that require extreme high communication reliability e.g.
> control command signaling applications like ATP.

## 12\.19
Allocation and isolation of FRMCS communication resources


### 12\.19\.1 Introduction


Rail communication distinguishes between critical, performance and
business applications. It is an essential task of the FRMCS System to
support segregation of data transmission, in this context the isolation
of railway application data utilizing the same available transport
resources. The principle of segregation of data transmission applies
to:


\- FRMCS communication infrastructure may be shared by multiple
railway undertakings;


\- Different railway applications of one railway undertaking require
isolated and customized communication resources (transport resources and
functionalities) for each application.


In general, it is anticipated that isolated transport services can be
provided with a predictable and guaranteed QoS.


### 12\.19\.2 Use
case: Isolation of FRMCS communication resources


#### 12\.19\.2\.1 Description


**Scenario 1: Isolation for individual railway
undertakings**


An FRMCS System infrastructure manager may have to host different
railway undertakings. Due to isolation reasons, these railway
undertakings require segregation of their communication and a
predictable and guaranteed QoS.


**Scenario 2: Isolation among categories of applications
belonging to one railway undertaking**


Railway community has classified their application to different
categories, i.e. critical, performance and business. Due to isolation
reasons, the related communications require segregation of data
transmission having a predictable and guaranteed QoS for the different
categories of applications.


#### 12\.19\.2\.2 Pre\-conditions


**General**


Segregation of data transmission is supported by the FRMCS
system.


**Scenario 1: Isolation reasons for individual railway
undertakings**


Railway undertakings need their own segregated transport resources
and network functionalities needed for their communications.


**Scenario 2: Isolation among categories of applications
belonging to one railway undertaking**


Railway undertaking assigns each application category to their own
segregated transport resources and network functionalities needed for
their communications.


#### 12\.19\.2\.3 Service flows


**Scenario 1: Isolation reasons for individual railway
undertakings**


Each railway undertaking in a country utilises dedicated and isolated
transport resources and network functionalities.


**Scenario 2: Isolation among categories of applications
belonging to one railway undertaking**


Each application category of one railway undertaking utilises
dedicated and isolated transport resources and network
functionalities.


#### 12\.19\.2\.4 Post\-conditions


**Scenario1**


Each railway undertaking in a country obtains dedicated and
segregated transport resources and network functionalities.


**Scenario2**


Each application category of one railway undertaking obtains
dedicated and segregated transport resources and network
functionalities.

## 12\.20
FRMCS Equipment capabilities for multiple FRMCS Users


### 12\.20\.1 Introduction


For communication, rail vehicles today have a dedicated terminal
approach. For each type of application, voice or data (e.g. ATP), one
(1:1\) or several mobile terminals (1: n) are used. Multiple Mobile
Terminals for one application are required for operational or
availability reasons.


With the introduction of the FRMCS System, the number of applications
will multiply. More recent train compositions already have a large
number of sensors whose information is exchanged for control or
diagnosis between the vehicle and the ground control centre.


With the continuation of the 1:1 principle (application equals mobile
terminal) this would correspond to a multiplication of the mobile
terminals. In addition, the space required for mobile terminals and roof
antennas would significantly increase.


### 12\.20\.2 Description


In the case of vehicle/train composition, FRMCS Users can take full
advantage of the transport facilities of the 3GPP system while ensuring
priority, latency and reliability for each communication. FRMCS User and
the associated communication applications need to be decoupled from the
FRMCS Equipment.


### 12\.20\.3 Pre\-conditions


At least one FRMCS Equipment is installed at the vehicle/train that
provides transport capabilities between vehicle/train to ground or vice
versa.


### 12\.20\.4 Service flows


Multiple FRMCS Users starts communication, for example:


\- ATP;

## 12\.21 FRMCS
System/FRMCS User roaming capabilities


### 12\.21\.1 Introduction


FRMCS Roaming use cases address the ability for an FRMCS User to make
use of FRMCS Applications when he is provided service by a network
different from his Home FRMCS Network. A specific use case applies for
FRMCS Functional Identities (see 12\.21\.3 use case).


It is essential for the operation of international trains,
transporting passenger or freight across borders, that FRMCS Users are
using the capabilities and services of other FRMCS networks.


The situations envisaged also encompass situations where trains are
moving to an area where a dedicated FRMCS network has been deployed for
an urban area, for a region, for a rail track operated by a different
company in a tunnel, in a large industrial area.


Other cases are pertinent for rail operation such as trains running
in countries or regions where communications services provided by the
local responsible Rail Infrastructure Manager are different from the one
where they have subscription or where service can only be provided by a
Public Mobile Network Operator.


FRMCS Roaming capabilities are necessary to ensure that Railways
Undertaking will be able to use a single FRMCS Equipment for their FRMCS
Users while roaming.


### 12\.21\.2

beyond the coverage of its Home FRMCS Network and where communications
services can be provided by another Visited (FRMCS) Network. Following
scenarios for an FRMCS User are:


\- Relocation from Home FRMCS Network to a Visited (FRMCS) Network and
vice versa;


\- Relocation from a Visited (FRMCS) Network to another Visited
(FRMCS) Network.


#### 12\.21\.2\.2 Pre\-conditions


The Visited (FRMCS) Network is capable to retrieve FRMCS Users
information from applicable Home FRMCS network.


#### 12\.21\.2\.3 Service flows

Home FRMCS Network and the FRMCS Application that are applicable in the
Visited (FRMCS) Network.


#### 12\.21\.2\.4 Post\-conditions

### 12\.21\.3
Use case: Functional Identities in FRMCS Roaming situations


#### 12\.21\.3\.1 Description


This use case addresses the situation where an FRMCS User or FRMCS
Equipment is moving beyond the coverage of its Home FRMCS Network and
where communications services can be provided by another Visited (FRMCS)
Network.


An FRMCS User or FRMCS Equipment in FRMCS Roaming situations
(referring to 12\.21\.2 use case) shall be able to make use of FRMCS
Functional Identities, from its Home FRMCS Network and, when applicable,
from Visited (FRMCS) Networks. For instance, an FRMCS User or FRMCS
Equipment in a train can be registered to a permanent FRMCS Functional
Identity with its Home FRMCS Network (associated with the engine), and
an FRMCS Functional Identity registered with a Visited (FRMCS) Network.
For train cross border operations (e.g. FRMCS Roaming situations), some
registered FRMCS Functional Identities shall remain valid for the
duration of the train international run, the same FRMCS Functional
Identity keeping the same association to FRMCS Equipment while border
crossing.


Each FRMCS Network shall maintain its own FRMCS Functional Identity
addressing scheme. For the purpose of FRMCS roaming, an international
FRMCS Functional Identity scheme will be used and national scheme will
align on it. If a train (e.g. an FRMCS User) is involved in cross border
operation, the FRMCS System shall detect automatically if an activated
FRMCS Functional Identity requires a re\-association to the local
applicable addressing domain. The responsible local functional
addressing entity in the Visiting (FRMCS) Network aligns the Home FRMCS
Network functional addressing entity about FRMCS Functional Identity
re\-association. The activation status of the re\-associated FRMCS
Functional Identity will be aligned accordingly. The responsible entity
of the functional address is keeping the status (active/inactive).


#### 12\.21\.3\.2 Pre\-conditions


FRMCS User is registered to at least one FRMCS Functional Identity F1
with its Home FRMCS Network.


FRMCS Equipment is associated with a permanent Functional Identity
administrated by the Home FRMCS Network.


The Visited (FRMCS) Network is capable to retrieve FRMCS Users
information from applicable Home FRMCS network.


#### 12\.21\.3\.3 Service flows


FRMCS User is relocating from Home FRMCS Network to Visited (FRMCS)
Network, or from a Visited (FRMCS) Network to another Visited (FRMCS)
Network.


FRMCS Users and FRMCS Equipment register to at least one FRMCS
Functional Identity F2 with the Visited (FRMCS) Network.


FRMCS User makes use of FRMCS Functional Identities associated with
the Home FRMCS Network, at least F1, and the FRMCS Functional Identities
associated with the Visited (FRMCS) Network, at least F2\.


#### 12\.21\.3\.4 Post\-conditions


An FRMCS User and FRMCS Equipment in FRMCS Roaming situations are
able to use FRMCS Functional Identities associated with both Home FRMCS
Network and Visited (FRMCS) Networks.

## 12\.22 Use case:
Availability – increasing measures


### 12\.22\.1 Description


In some regions railways are a major constituent for the economy.
Disturbance in the complex railway system can have a significant impact
for example in the manufacturing process if components cannot be
delivered in\-time. There are significant improvements in train
punctuality and track utilisation by using Automatic Train Protection
(ATP) systems. Unavailability of the FRMCS System, FRMCS sub\-systems or
simple components can cause a significant impact to railway
operation.


ATP provides different levels of operation. The moving block mode is
the most demanding one that requires multiple times more information in
one second, e.g., position reports from the train towards the ground
controlling entity which computes continuously the risk that consecutive
trains can collide.


In order to minimise the risk of FRMCS System unavailability, Single
Point of Failures (SPOF) need to be eliminated. There are different
strategies such as duplication of components, subsystems or the entire
system. The mode of system redundancy ranges from hot\-standby,
warm\-standby to cold\-standby. Hot\-standby is the most demanding mode and
requires an instantaneous continuation of the end\-to\-end service. Also
the use of only one spectrum block represents a SPOF. In case one
spectrum block become unavailable due to wideband jamming or similar,
the FRMCS System needs to be able to make flexible use of spectrum to
minimize the risk of radio path unavailability.


FRMCS System or sub\-system maintenance may cause outages of some
minutes or hours. Today, a high utilisation of rail tracks already
reduces the number of maintenance windows. A redundant deployment of the
radio access sub\-system allows continuation of rail operation while one
part of radio access sub\-system is under maintenance.


### 12\.22\.2 Pre\-conditions


The basis for setting up the FRMCS System takes into account the
elimination of Single Point Of Failure which encompasses:


* Usage of multiple independent spectrum blocks;
* Duplication of system functionalities/entities of the FRMCS
System.


### 12\.22\.3 Service flows


**Case 1:**


During train control operation, some portion of the used spectrum
block is disturbed, e.g., through interference from an external
source.


**Case 2:**


During train control operation a FRMCS sub\-system fails or has been
put under maintenance.


### 12\.22\.4 Post\-conditions


The communication service continues without interruption.


Train operation efficiency is not affected in any way despite the
disturbances caused by:


* Interference (intentional or unintentional);
* Unavailability of FRMCS sub\-systems due to planned (maintenance)
or unplanned (outage) reasons.

## 12\.23
Use case: Flexible use of available contiguous spectrum blocks(s) and
related bandwidth(s)


### 12\.23\.1 Introduction


Globally, different contiguous spectrum block(s) with related
bandwidth(s) may be available for rail communication in different areas.
An FRMCS Equipment may also support different contiguous spectrum
block(s) with related bandwidth(s) than the infrastructure deployed in
the area. The use case addresses the general requirements related to the
ability of the FRMCS System to flexibly use the maximum extent of rail
spectrum available in an area, also considering the capabilities of the
FRMCS Equipment that is served.


### 12\.23\.2 Description


It is essential that the FRMCS system can flexibly utilize the
available bandwidth of the contiguous spectrum block(s), for both
On\-network and Off\-network communication, also considering the
contiguous spectrum block(s) and related bandwidth(s) supported by
served FRMCS Equipment.


### 12\.23\.3 Pre\-conditions


In certain areas, specific contiguous spectrum block(s) and related
bandwidth(s) are available for rail communication. An FRMCS Equipment
served in the area supports (possibly different) specific contiguous
spectrum block(s) and their related bandwidth(s).


### 12\.23\.4 Service flows


The FRMCS System obtains information about the specific contiguous
spectrum block(s) and their related bandwidth(s) supported by the FRMCS
Equipment.


The FRMCS System allocates the locally available contiguous spectrum
block(s) and their related bandwidth(s), and serves FRMCS Equipment
according to its supported contiguous spectrum block(s) and their
related bandwidth(s).


### 12\.23\.5 Post\-conditions


The FRMCS System is able to flexibly use the maximum extent of rail
spectrum available in a given area, also considering the capabilities of
the FRMCS Equipment that is served.

considered for introduction in Rel\-15 normative specifications. Only
parts of “9\.3 Role management and presence” and “9\.7 Multiuser talker
control related use cases” were introduced. All other requirements
identified in the TR above but not listed below are not covered in
Rel\-15\.


The third column “SA1 spec covering” identifies the specification and
the requirement number within that specification where the 22\.889
requirement with the number as specified in the first column of the
table is covered. The fourth column provide additional explanation if
needed.

Communication. It is proposed to start normative work based on these
potential requirements.


Where applicable, it is proposed to include the requirements
identified by this work into the set of existing stage 1 missing
critical and other specifications.


Requirements not fitting to any existing specification are proposed
to go into a new TS.


  

Annex A: Examples of Role management


This annex gives some examples on how Role management is used in the
railway environment. This is to better understand the use.


**Functional identity**


Every operational railway function e.g. train driver, a shunter or
Controller is identified by their functions. A non\-exhaustive list is
provided in the table underneath.






| Functional identities |
| --- |
| Leading train driver |
| Driver 2 |
| Driver 3 |
| Shunting leader |
| Shunting member |
| Track side maintenance leader |
| Track side maintenance member |
| Primary train controller |
| Secondary train controller |
| Power controller |
| Shunting controller |
| Trackside maintenance controller |
| Platform inspector |
| Public announcement |
| Chief conductor |
| Second conductor |
| Third conductor |
| Catering staff chief |
| Diagnostics |


In order to make a function of a user known to other users, the user
has to register itself to a specific functional identity.


For example, user can be authorised by the railway undertaking to be
a train driver (functional Role) of a train. When the Driver starts the
scheduled train ride, from A to B at time x, the train running schedule
assigns a specific train running number for this train. In principle the
train keeps this number for the complete journey. The train driver uses
his communication equipment to register himself, as the leading train
driver (functional Role), of train number 123 (functional identity).
After registration the train driver is now registered to the FRMCS
System as the leading train driver of train 123\. In some cases there can
be multiple Drivers on one train, so the individual Drivers can register
themselves accordingly.


**FRMCS Equipment Type**


The equipment used in the railway environment can be very specific.
The FRMCS Equipment is constituted of an UE and the FRMCS Application on
this UE. This depends on the location and situation the equipment is
used. The following different equipment types can be used, as an
example:







| Equipment type | Equipment Capabilities (Examples) |
| --- | --- |
| Cabin radio | Emergency button, external loudspeaker |
| Shunting radio | Loudspeaker, hands free |
| Trackside maintenance radio |  |
| Security staff radio | Emergency button, public emergency call button |
| Catering staff radio |  |
| Train controller device | Emergency button, call to maintenance staff button, call to power controllers button |
| Shunting controller device |  |
| Sensor | No HMI |


These different types of FRMCS Equipment are relevant for the
registration process of functional identities. For example a train
driver cannot register to a functional identity using a FRMCS Equipment
which is not fit for the train driver to perform his Role. So a train
driver cannot perform a registration as train driver of train 123 if he
uses a catering staff FRMCS Equipment (where there is no train emergency
button available, no loudspeaker and handset, etc.). The registration
request will be rejected by the FRMCS System.


The FRMCS Equipment shall also be reachable based on the identity of
the FRMCS Equipment. For example the cabin radio of a specific train can
be reached by their FRMCS Equipment Identity.


**FRMCS User identity**


The railway employee (a specific person) is also reachable even if no
functional identity has been assigned. This is done by using a unique
FRMCS User identity. This can be an E.164 number, any other number
according to a specific railways numbering plan or by fully qualified
domain names (FQDN). Such a number or FQDN is dedicated/ assigned to a
specific railway employee. After the employee has performed the log\-in
procedure to the FRMCS System, he is reachable via his individual FRMCS
User identity.


  

Annex B: Minimum functional and performance requirements for FRMCS from
a perspective of Korea LTE\-based railway services


In this annex, minimum functional and performance requirements
\[5]\-\[6] are introduced for FRMCS from a perspective of Korea's LTE\-based
railway services. Here, the term ‘minimum’ is used from the fact that
the requirements are expected to be satisfied even with previous Rel.
version of 3GPP LTE. Specifically, all the functionalities and
performance requirements except for the high speed (500km/h) listed in
the above have been shown to be fully supported by LTE Rel. 9, which
have been validated in a commercial railway with a length of 54\.2km \[7].
Also, train control service named as Korea Radio\-Based Train Control
System (KRTCS) has been shown to be feasible by handling priorities
among multiple data, where the level of KRTCS is equivalent to European
Train Control System (ETCS) level 3 in a train control perspective. All
the specific test scenarios regarding functional and performance
requirements including KRTCS have been validated in a commercial railway
\[8]. For promising FRMCS supporting LTE Rel. 15, more enhanced and
sophisticated requirements should be provided. In that sense, these
requirements can be considered as basic functional and performance
requirements for FRMCS.

In a communication perspective, the followings can be minimum
functional requirements for LTE based railway communication systems. The
contents of each function and each digital radio equipment are described
