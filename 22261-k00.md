# Introduction


The need to support different kinds of UEs (e.g. for the Internet of
Things (IoT)), services, and technologies is driving the technology
revolution to a high\-performance and highly efficient 3GPP system. The
drivers include IoT, Virtual Reality (VR), industrial control,
ubiquitous on\-demand coverage, as well as the opportunity to meet
customized market needs. These drivers require enhancements to the
devices, services, and technologies well established by 3GPP. The key
objective with the 5G system is to be able to support new deployment
scenarios to address diverse market segments.


This document compiles requirements that define a 5G system.


The 5G system is characterised, for example, by:


\- Support for multiple access technologies


\- Scalable and customizable network


\- Advanced Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) (e.g. availability,
latency, reliability, user experienced data rates, area traffic
capacity)


\- Flexibility and programmability (e.g. network slicing, diverse
mobility management, Network Function Virtualization)


\- Resource efficiency (both user plane and control plane)


\- Seamless mobility in densely populated and heterogeneous
environment


\- Support for real time and non\-real time multimedia services and
applications with advanced Quality of Experience (QoE)


# 1 Scope


The present document describes the service and operational
requirements for a 5G system, including a UE, NG\-RAN, and 5G Core
network. Requirements for a 5G E\-UTRA\-NR Dual Connectivity in E\-UTRAN
connected to EPC are found in TS 22\.278 \[5].

# 4 Overview


Unlike previous 3GPP systems that attempted to provide a 'one size
fits all' system, the 5G system is expected to be able to provide
optimized support for a variety of different services, different traffic
loads, and different end user communities. Various industry white
papers, most notably, the NGMN 5G White Paper \[2], describe a
multi\-faceted 5G system capable of simultaneously supporting multiple
combinations of reliability, latency, throughput, positioning, and
availability. This technology revolution is achievable with the
introduction of new technologies, both in access and the core, such as
flexible, scalable assignment of network resources. In addition to
increased flexibility and optimization, a 5G system needs to support
stringent KPIs for latency, reliability, throughput, etc. Enhancements
in the radio interface contribute to meeting these KPIs as do
enhancements in the core network, such as network slicing, in\-network
caching and hosting services closer to the end points.


A 5G system also supports new business models such as those for IoT
and enterprise managed networks. Drivers for the 5G KPIs include
services such as Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) control, Augmented
Reality (AR), and factory automation. Network flexibility enhancements
support self\-contained enterprise networks, installed and maintained by
network operators while being managed by the enterprise. Enhanced
connection modes and evolved security facilitate support of massive IoT,
expected to include tens of millions of UEs sending and receiving data
over the 5G network.


Flexible network operations are the mainstay of the 5G system. The
capabilities to provide this flexibility include network slicing,
network capability exposure, scalability, and diverse mobility. Other
network operations requirements address the necessary control and data
plane resource efficiencies, as well as network configurations that
optimize service delivery by minimizing routing between end users and
application servers. Enhanced charging and security mechanisms handle
new types of UEs connecting to the network in different ways. The
enhanced flexibility of the 5G system also allows to cater to the needs
of various verticals. For example, the 5G system introduces the concept
of non\-public networks providing exclusive access for a specific set of
users and specific purpose(s). Non\-public networks can, depending on
deployment and (national) regulations, support different subsets of 5G
functionality. In this specification 5G network requirements apply to
both NPNs and PLMNs, unless specified otherwise. Additionally, there are
specific requirements dedicated only to NPNs or PLMNs, which are
indicated accordingly. More information can be found in Section
6\.25\.


Mobile Broadband (MBB) enhancements aim to meet a number of new KPIs.
These pertain to high data rates, high user density, high user mobility,
highly variable data rates, deployment, and coverage. High data rates
are driven by the increasing use of data for services such as streaming
(e.g. video, music, and user generated content), interactive services
(e.g. AR), and IoT. These services come with stringent requirements for
user experienced data rates as well as associated requirements for
latency to meet service requirements. Additionally, increased coverage
in densely populated areas such as sports arenas, urban areas, and
transportation hubs has become essential for pedestrians and users in
urban vehicles. New KPIs on traffic and connection density enable both
the transport of high volumes of data traffic per area (traffic density)
and transport of data for a high number of connections (e.g. UE density
or connection density). Many UEs are expected to support a variety of
services which exchange either a very large (e.g. streaming video) or
very small (e.g. data burst) amount of data. The 5G system will handle
this variability in a resource efficient manner. All of these cases
introduce new deployment requirements for indoor and outdoor, local area
connectivity, high user density, wide area connectivity, and UEs
travelling at high speeds.


Another aspect of 5G KPIs includes requirements for various
combinations of latency and reliability, as well as higher accuracy for
positioning. These KPIs are driven by support for both commercial and
public safety services. On the commercial side, industrial control,
industrial automation, UAV control, and AR are examples of those
services. Services such as UAV control will require more precise
positioning information that includes altitude, speed, and direction, in
addition to horizontal coordinates.


Support for Massive Internet of Things (MIoT) brings many new
requirements in addition to those for the enhanced KPIs. The expansion
of connected things introduces a need for significant improvements in
resource efficiency in all system components (e.g. UEs, IoT devices,
radio, access network, core network).


The 5G system also aims to enhance its capability to meet KPIs that
emerging V2X applications require. For these advanced applications, the
requirements, such as data rate, reliability, latency, communication
range and speed, are made more stringent.

# 6 Basic capabilities


## 6\.1 Network slicing


### 6\.1\.1 Description


Network slicing allows the operator to provide customised networks.
For example, there can be different requirements on functionality (e.g.
priority, charging, policy control, security, and mobility), differences
in performance requirements (e.g. latency, mobility, availability,
reliability and data rates), or they can serve only specific users (e.g.
MPS users, Public Safety users, corporate customers, roamers, or hosting
an MVNO).


A network slice can provide the functionality of a complete network,
including radio access network functions, core network functions (e.g.
potentially from different vendors) and IMS functions. One network can
support one or several network slices.


### 6\.1\.2 Requirements


#### 6\.1\.2\.1 General

slice.


The 5G system shall be able to support IMS independent of network
slices.


For a UE authorized to access multiple network slices of one operator

frequency restrictions), the 5G system shall be able to support the UE
to access the most suitable network slice in minimum time (e.g. based on
the location of the UE, ongoing applications, UE capability, frequency

(e.g. reduce unnecessary cell measurements), in an area where no
authorized network slice is available.


When a UE moves out of the service area of a network slice for an
active application, the 5G system shall be able to minimize impact on
the active applications (e.g., providing early notification).

toward the border area and to notify the UE.


The 5G system shall support a mechanism for a UE to select and access
network slice(s) based on UE capability, ongoing application, radio
resources assigned to the slice, and policy (e.g., application
preference).

offer different network slices) based on network slice usage patterns
and policy (e.g., application preference) of a UE or group of UEs


For UEs that have the ability to obtain service from more than one
VPLMN simultaneously, the following requirements apply:


\- When a roaming UE with a single PLMN subscription requires
simultaneous access to multiple network slices and the network slices
are not available in a single VPLMN, the 5G system shall enable the UE
to:


\- be registered to more than one VPLMN simultaneously; and


\- use network slices from more than one VPLMN simultaneously


\- The HPLMN shall be able to authorise a roaming UE with a single
PLMN subscription to be registered to more than one VPLMN simultaneously
in order to access network slices of those VPLMNs.


\- The HPLMN shall be able to provide a UE with permission and
prioritisation information of the VPLMNs the UE is authorised to
register to in order to use specific network slices.


NOTE 2: The above requirements assume certain UE capabilities, e.g.
the ability to be connected to more than one PLMN simultaneously.


#### 6\.1\.2\.2 Management


The 5G system shall allow the operator to create, modify, and delete
a network slice.


The 5G system shall allow the operator to define and update the set

which associates a UE to a network slice.


The 5G system shall allow the operator to configure the information
which associates a service to a network slice.


The 5G system shall allow the operator to assign a UE to a network
slice, to move a UE from one network slice to another, and to remove a
UE from a network slice based on subscription, UE capabilities, the
access technology being used by the UE, operator's policies and services
provided by the network slice.


The 5G system shall support a mechanism for the VPLMN, as authorized
by the HPLMN, to assign a UE to a network slice with the needed services
or to a default network slice.


The 5G system shall enable a UE to be simultaneously assigned to and
access services from more than one network slice of one operator.


Traffic and services in one network slice shall have no impact on
traffic and services in other network slices in the same network.


Creation, modification, and deletion of a network slice shall have no
or minimal impact on traffic and services in other network slices in the
same network.


The 5G system shall support scaling of a network slice, i.e.
adaptation of its capacity.


The 5G system shall enable the network operator to define a minimum
available capacity for a network slice. Scaling of other network slices
on the same network shall have no impact on the availability of the
minimum capacity for that network slice.


The 5G system shall enable the network operator to define a maximum
capacity (e.g., number of UEs, number of data sessions) for a network
slice.


The 5G system shall enable the network operator to define a priority
order between different network slices in case multiple network slices
compete for resources on the same network.


The 5G system shall support means by which the operator can
differentiate policy control, functionality and performance provided in
different network slices.


#### 6\.1\.2\.3 Network slice
constraints


The 5G system shall support a mechanism to prevent a UE from trying
to access a radio resource dedicated to a specific private slice for any
purpose other than that authorized by the associated third\-party.


NOTE 1: UEs that are not authorized to access a specific private
slice will not be able to access it for emergency calls if the private
slice does not support emergency services.


The 5G system shall support a mechanism to configure a specific
geographic area in which a network slice is accessible, i.e. a UE shall
be within the geographical area in order to access the network
slice.


The 5G system shall support a mechanism to limit a UE to only
receiving service from an authorized slice.


For a UE authorized to access to multiple network slices of one
operator which cannot be simultaneously used by the UE (e.g. due to
radio frequency restrictions), the 5G system shall minimize service
interruption time when the UE changes the access from one network slice
to another network slice. (e.g. based on changes of active
applications).


For traffic pertaining to a network slice offered via a relay node,
5G system shall use only radio resources (e.g. frequency band) allowed
for the network slice.


NOTE 2: Allowed radio resources (e.g., frequency band) may be
different for direct network connections (between UE and NG\-RAN) than
for backhaul connections (between the relay node and the NG\-RAN).


The 5G system shall support a mechanism to prevent a UE from
registering with a network slice when the maximum number of UEs for that
slice are registered.


The 5G system shall support a mechanism to prevent a UE from

exemptions can be provided for UEs configured for priority
services (e.g., MPS) and for priority service sessions.


#### 6\.1\.2\.4 Cross\-network slice
coordination


The 5G system shall support a mechanism to provide time stamps with a
common time base at the monitoring API, for services that cross multiple
network slices and 5G networks.


The 5G system shall provide suitable APIs to coordinate network
slices in multiple 5G networks so that the selected communication
services of a non\-public network can be extended through a PLMN (e.g.
the service is supported by a slice in the non\-public network and a
slice in the PLMN).


The 5G system shall provide a mechanism to enable an MNO to operate a
hosted non\-public network and private slice(s) of its PLMN associated
with the hosted non\-public network in a combined manner.


## 6\.2 Diverse mobility
management


### 6\.2\.1 Description


A key feature of 5G is support for UEs with different mobility
management needs. 5G will support UEs with a range of mobility
management needs, including UEs that are


\- stationary during their entire usable life (e.g. sensors embedded
in infrastructure),


\- stationary during active periods, but nomadic between activations
(e.g. fixed access),


\- mobile within a constrained and well\-defined space (e.g. in a
factory), and


\- fully mobile.


Moreover, some applications require the network to ensure seamless
mobility of a UE so that mobility is hidden from the application layer
to avoid interruptions in service delivery while other applications have
application specific means to ensure service continuity. But these other
applications can still require the network to minimize interruption time
to ensure that their application\-specific means to ensure service
continuity work effectively.


With the ever\-increasing multimedia broadband data volumes, it is
also important to enable the offloading of IP traffic from the 5G
network onto traditional IP routing networks via an IP anchor node close
to the network edge. As the UE moves, changing the IP anchor node can be
needed in order to reduce the traffic load in the system, reduce
end\-to\-end latency and provide a better user experience.


The flexible nature of a 5G system will support different mobility
management methods that minimize signalling overhead and optimize access
for these different types of UEs.


### 6\.2\.2 General requirements


The 5G network shall allow operators to optimize network behaviour
(e.g. mobility management support) based on the mobility patterns (e.g.
stationary, nomadic, spatially restricted mobility, full mobility) of a
UE or group of UEs.


The 5G system shall enable operators to specify and modify the types
of mobility support provided for a UE or group of UEs.


The 5G system shall optimize mobility management support for a UE or
group of UEs that use only mobile originated communications.


The 5G system shall support inter\- and/or intra\- access technology
mobility procedures within 5GS with minimum impact to the user
experience (e.g. QoS, QoE).


### 6\.2\.3 Service continuity
requirements


The 5G system shall enable packet loss to be minimized during inter\-
and/or intra\- access technology changes for some or all connections
associated with a UE.


The 5G system shall minimize interruption time during inter\- and/or
intra\- access technology mobility for some or all connections associated
with a UE.


NOTE: The interruption time includes all delays which have impact on
service continuity.


For applications that require the same IP address during the lifetime
of the session, the 5G system shall enable maintaining the IP address
assigned to a UE when moving across different cells and access
technologies for connections associated with a UE.


The 5G system shall enable minimizing impact to the user experience
(e.g. minimization of interruption time) when changing the IP address
and IP anchoring point for some or all connections associated with a
UE.


The 5G system shall support service continuity for a remote UE, when
the remote UE changes from a direct network connection to an indirect
network connection and vice\-versa.


The 5G system shall support service continuity for a remote UE, when
the remote UE changes from one relay UE to another and both relay UEs
use 3GPP access to the 5G core network.


Satellite access related service continuity requirements are covered
in clause 6\.46\.3\.


### 6\.2\.4 Roaming related
requirements


Satellite access related roaming requirements are covered in clause
6\.46\.4\.


## 6\.3 Multiple access
technologies


### 6\.3\.1 Description


The 5G system will support 3GPP access technologies, including one or
more NR and E\-UTRA as well as non\-3GPP access technologies.
Interoperability among the various access technologies will be
imperative. For optimization and resource efficiency, the 5G system will
select the most appropriate 3GPP or non\-3GPP access technology for a
service, potentially allowing multiple access technologies to be used
simultaneously for one or more services active on a UE. New technology
such as satellite and wide area base stations will increase coverage and
availability. This clause provides requirements for interworking with
the various combinations of access technologies.


### 6\.3\.2 Requirements


#### 6\.3\.2\.1 General


Based on operator policy, the 5G system shall enable the UE to
select, manage, and efficiently provision services over the 3GPP or
non\-3GPP access.


Based on operator policy, the 5G system shall support steering a UE
to select certain 3GPP access network(s).


Based on operator policy, the 5G system shall be able to dynamically
offload part of the traffic (e.g. from 3GPP RAT to non\-3GPP access
technology), taking into account traffic load and traffic type.


Based on operator policy, the 5G system shall be able to provide
simultaneous data transmission via different access technologies (e.g.
NR, E\-UTRA, non\-3GPP), to access one or more 3GPP services.


When a UE is using two or more access technologies simultaneously,
the 5G system shall be able to optimally distribute user traffic over
the access technologies in use, taking into account e.g. service,
traffic characteristics, radio characteristics, and UE's moving
speed.


The 5G system shall be able to support data transmissions optimized
for different access technologies (e.g. 3GPP, non\-3GPP) and accesses to
local data networks (e.g. local traffic routing) for UEs that are
simultaneously connected to the network via different accesses.


NOTE: This applies to the scenario with simultaneous 3GPP and
non\-3GPP accesses.


Based on operator policy, the 5G system shall be able to add or drop
the various access connections for a UE during a session.


The 5G system shall be able to support mobility between the supported
access networks (e.g. NG\-RAN, WLAN, fixed broadband access network, 5G
satellite access network).


The 5G system shall support UEs with multiple radio and single radio
capabilities.


The 5G system shall support dynamic and static network address
allocation of a common network address to the UE over all supported
access types.

order to provide a consistent set of policies and a single set of
services across 3GPP and non\-3GPP access types.

and/or unlicensed bands.


#### 6\.3\.2\.2 E\-UTRA access


The 5G system shall be able to support seamless handover between NR
and E\-UTRA.


The 5G system shall support UEs with dual radio capability (i.e. a UE
that can transmit on NR and E\-UTRA simultaneously) as well as UEs with
single radio capability (i.e. a UE that cannot transmit on NR and E\-UTRA
simultaneously).


#### 6\.3\.2\.3 Satellite access


The 5G system shall be able to provide services using satellite
access.


NOTE: Additional requirements related to satellite access can be
found in clause 6\.46\.


#### 6\.3\.2\.4 Fixed broadband access


The 5G system shall be able to efficiently support connectivity using
fixed broadband access.


NOTE: The specification of fixed broadband access network is outside
the scope of 3GPP.


The 5G system shall support use of a relay UE that supports multiple
access types (e.g. 5G RAT, WLAN access, fixed broadband access).


The 5G system shall support use of a home base station that supports
multiple access types (e.g. 5G RAT, WLAN access, fixed broadband
access).


## 6\.4 Resource efficiency


### 6\.4\.1 Description


5G introduces the opportunity to design a system to be optimized for
supporting diverse UEs and services. While support for IoT is provided
by EPS, there is room for improvement in efficient resource utilization
that can be designed into a 5G system whereas they are not easily
retrofitted into an existing system. Some of the underlying principles
of the potential service and network operation requirements associated
with efficient configuration, deployment, and use of UEs in the 5G
network include bulk provisioning, resource efficient access,
optimization for UE originated data transfer, and efficiencies based on
the reduced needs related to mobility management for stationary UEs and
UEs with restricted range of movement.


As sensors and monitoring UEs are deployed more extensively, the need
to support UEs that send data packages ranging in size from a small
status update in a few bits to streaming video increases. A similar need
exists for smart phones with widely varying amounts of data.
Specifically, to support short data bursts, the network should be able
to operate in a mode where there is no need for a lengthy and high
overhead signalling procedure before and after small amounts of data are
sent. The system will, as a result, avoid both a negative impact to
battery life for the UE and wasting signalling resources.


For small form factor UEs it will be challenging to have more than 1
antenna due to the inability to get good isolation between multiple
antennas. Thus, these UEs need to meet the expected performance in a 5G
network with only one antenna.


Cloud applications like cloud robotics perform computation in the
network rather than in a UE, which requires the system to have high data
rate in the uplink and very low round trip latency. Supposed that high
density cloud robotics will be deployed in the future, the 5G system
need to optimize the resource efficiency for such scenario.


Additional resource efficiencies will contribute to meeting the
various KPIs defined for 5G. Control plane resource efficiencies can be
achieved by optimizing and minimizing signalling overhead, particularly
for small data transmissions. Mechanisms for minimizing user plane
resources utilization include in\-network caching and application in a
Service Hosting Environment closer to the end user. These optimization
efforts contribute to achieving lower latency and higher
reliability.


Diverse mobility management related resource efficiencies are covered
in clause 6\.2\.


Security related resource efficiencies are covered in clause 8\.8\.


### 6\.4\.2 Requirements


#### 6\.4\.2\.1 General


The 5G system shall minimize control and user plane resource usage
for data transfer from send only UEs.


The 5G system shall minimize control and user plane resource usage
for stationary UEs (e.g. lower signalling to user data resource usage
ratio).


The 5G system shall minimize control and user plane resource usage
for transfer of infrequent small data units.


The 5G system shall optimize the resource use of the control plane
and/or user plane for transfer of small data units.


The 5G system shall optimize the resource use of the control plane
and/or user plane for transfer of continuous uplink data that requires
both high data rate (e.g. 10 Mbit/s) and very low end\-to\-end latency
(e.g. 1\-10 ms).


The 5G network shall optimize the resource use of the control plane
and/or user plane to support high density connections (e.g. 1 million
connections per square kilometre) taking into account, for example, the
following criteria:


\- type of mobility support;


\- communication pattern (e.g. send\-only, frequent or infrequent);


\- characteristics of payload (e.g. small or large size data
payload);


\- characteristics of application (e.g. provisioning operation, normal
data transfer);


\- UE location;


\- timing pattern of data transfer (e.g. real time or non\-delay
sensitive).


The 5G system shall efficiently support service discovery mechanisms
where UEs can discover, subject to access rights:


\- status of other UEs (e.g. sound on/off);


\- capabilities of other UEs (e.g. the UE is a relay UE) and/or;


\- services provided by other UEs (e.g. the UE is a colour
printer).


The 5G system shall be able to minimise the amount of wireless
backhaul traffic (e.g. consolidating data transmissions to 1 larger
rather than many smaller), when applicable (e.g. providing service in an
area subject to power outages).


The 5G system shall support small form factor UEs with single
antenna.


NOTE: Small form factor UEs are typically expected to have the
diagonal less than 1/5 of the lowest supported frequency wave
length.


Satellite access related resource efficiency requirements are covered
in clause 6\.46\.5\.


#### 6\.4\.2\.2 Efficient bulk
operations for IoT


The 5G network shall optimize the resource use of the control plane
and/or user plane to support bulk operation for high connection density
(e.g. 1 million connections per square kilometre) of multiple UEs.


The 5G system shall support a timely, efficient, and/or reliable
mechanism to transmit the same information to multiple UEs.


#### 6\.4\.2\.3 Efficient management for
IoT


The 5G network shall optimize the resource use of the control plane
and/or user plane to manage (e.g. provide service parameters, activate,
deactivate) a UE.


The 5G network shall be able to provide policies for background data
transfer to a UE so that the 5G system can optimally use the control
plane and/or user plane resources.


#### 6\.4\.2\.4 Efficient control plane


The 5G system shall minimize the signalling that is required prior to
user data transmission.


NOTE: The amount of signalling overhead may vary based on the amount
of data to be transmitted, even for the same UE.


## 6\.5 Efficient user plane


### 6\.5\.1 Description


5G is designed to meet diverse services with different and enhanced
performances (e.g. high throughput, low latency and massive connections)
and data traffic model (e.g. IP data traffic, non\-IP data traffic, short
data bursts and high throughput data transmissions).


User plane should be more efficient for 5G to support differentiated
requirements. On one hand, a Service Hosting Environment located inside
of operator's network can offer Hosted Services closer to the end user
to meet localization requirement like low latency, low bandwidth
pressure. These Hosted Services contain applications provided by
operators and/or trusted 3rd parties. On the other hand, user plane
paths can be selected or changed to improve the user experience or
reduce the bandwidth pressure, when a UE or application changes location
during an active communication, or due to operational needs in the
service hosting environment (e.g. based on usage information).


The 5G network can also support multiple wireless backhaul
connections (e.g. satellites and/or terrestrial), and efficiently route
and/or bundle traffic among them.


### 6\.5\.2 Requirements


Based on operator policy, application needs, or both, the 5G system
shall support an efficient user plane path between UEs attached to the
same network, modifying the path as needed when the UE moves during an
active communication.


The 5G network shall enable a Service Hosting Environment provided by
operator.


Based on operator policy, the 5G network shall be able to support
routing of data traffic between a UE attached to the network and an
application in a Service Hosting Environment for specific services,
modifying the path as needed when the UE moves during an active
communication.


Based on operator policy, application needs, or both, the 5G system
shall support an efficient user plane path, modifying the path as needed
when the UE moves or application changes location, between a UE in an
active communication and:


\- an application in a Service Hosting Environment; or


\- an application server located outside the operator’s network;
or


\- an application server located in a customer premises network or
personal IoT network.


The 5G network shall maintain user experience (e.g. QoS, QoE) when a
UE in an active communication moves from a location served by a Service
Hosting Environment to:


\- another location served by a different Service Hosting Environment;
or


\- another location served by an application server located outside
the operator’s network; or


\- another location served by an application server located in a
customer premises network or personal IoT network, and vice versa.


The 5G network shall maintain user experience (e.g. QoS, QoE) when an
application for a UE moves as follows:


\- within a Service Hosting Environment; or

particular UE.


Based on operator policy, the 5G system shall provide a mechanism
such that one type of traffic (from a specific application or service)
to/from a UE can be offloaded close to the UE's point of attachment to
the access network, while not impacting other traffic type to/from that
same UE.

Service.


## 6\.6 Efficient content delivery


### 6\.6\.1 Description


Video\-based services (e.g. live streaming, VR) and personal data
storage applications have been instrumental for the massive growth in
mobile broadband traffic. Subject to service agreement between the
operator and the content provider, the information of content and
content itself can be aware by operator. In\-network content caching
provided by the operator, a third\-party or both, can improve user
experience, reduce backhaul resource usage and utilize radio resource
efficiently.


The operation of in\-network caching includes flexible management of
the location of the content cache within the network and efficient
delivery of content to and from the appropriate content caching
application. Examples of services are the delivery of popular video
content from a content caching application via broadcast, and secure
storage of a user's personal data or files using a distributed caching
application. Such a service could also provide a student with a wireless
backpack, where students can resume their work through the same or a
different UE at any time, with very fast response times from the
network.


### 6\.6\.2 Requirements


The 5G system shall enable efficient delivery of content from a
content caching application under the control of the operator (e.g. a
cache located close to the UE).


The 5G system shall support a content caching application in a UE
under the control of the operator.


The 5G system shall support configurations of content caching
applications in the network (e.g. access network, core network), that
provide content close to the UE.


Based on operator policy, the 5G system shall support an efficient
mechanism for selection of a content caching application (e.g. minimize
utilization of radio, backhaul resources and/or application resource)
for delivery of the cached content to the UE.


The 5G system shall support a mechanism for the operator to manage
content distribution across content caching applications.


The 5G system shall support delivery of cached content from a content
caching application via the broadcast/multicast service.


For a 5G system with satellite access, the following requirement
applies.


\- A 5G system with satellite access shall be able to optimise the
delivery of content from a content caching application by taking
advantage of satellites in supporting ubiquitous service, as well as
broadcasting/multicasting on very large to global coverages.


## 6\.7 Priority, QoS, and policy
control


### 6\.7\.1 Description


The 5G network will support many commercial services (e.g. medical)
and regional or national regulatory services (e.g. MPS, Emergency,
Public Safety) with requirements for priority treatment. Some of these
services share common QoS characteristics such as latency and packet
loss rate but can have different priority requirements. For example, UAV
control and air traffic control can have stringent latency and
reliability requirements but not necessarily the same priority
requirements. In addition, voice\-based services for MPS and Emergency
share common QoS characteristics as applicable for normal public voice
communications yet can have different priority requirements. The 5G
network will need to support mechanisms that enable the decoupling of
the priority of a particular communication from the associated QoS
characteristics such as latency and reliability to allow flexibility to
support different priority services (that need to be configurable to
meet operator needs, consistent with operator policies and corresponding
national and regional regulatory policies).


The network needs to support flexible means to make priority
decisions based on the state of the network (e.g. during disaster events
and network congestion) recognizing that the priority needs can change
during a crisis. The priority of any service can be different for a user
of that service based on operational needs and regional or national
regulations. Therefore, the 5G system should allow a flexible means to
prioritise and enforce prioritisation among the services (e.g. MPS,
Emergency, medical, Public Safety) and among the users of these
services. The traffic prioritisation can be enforced by adjusting
resource utilization or pre\-empting lower priority traffic.


The network must offer means to provide the required QoS (e.g.
reliability, latency, and bandwidth) for a service and the ability to
prioritize resources when necessary to meet the service requirements.
Existing QoS and policy frameworks handle latency and improve
reliability by traffic engineering. In order to support 5G service
requirements, it is necessary for the 5G network to offer QoS and policy
control for reliable communication with latency required for a service
and enable the resource adaptations as necessary.


The network needs to allow multiple services to coexist, including
multiple priority services (e.g. Emergency, MPS and MCS) and must
provide means to prevent a single service from consuming or monopolizing
all available network resources, or impacting the QoS (e.g.
availability) of other services competing for resources on the same
network under specific network conditions. For example, it is necessary
to prevent certain services (e.g. citizen\-to\-authority Emergency)
sessions from monopolizing all available resources during events such as
disaster, emergency, and DDoS attacks from impacting the availability of
other priority services such as MPS and MCS.


Also, as 5G network is expected to operate in a heterogeneous
environment with multiple access technologies, multiple types of UE,
etc., it should support a harmonised QoS and policy framework that
applies to multiple accesses.


Further, for QoS control in EPS only covers RAN and core network, but
for 5G network E2E QoS (e.g. RAN, backhaul, core network, network to
network interconnect) is needed to achieve the 5G user experience (e.g.
ultra\-low latency, ultra\-high bandwidth).


### 6\.7\.2 Requirements


The 5G system shall allow flexible mechanisms to establish and
enforce priority policies among the different services (e.g. MPS,
Emergency, medical, Public Safety) and users.


NOTE 1: Priority between different services is subject to regional or
national regulatory and operator policies.


The 5G system shall be able to provide the required QoS (e.g.
reliability, end\-to\-end latency, and bandwidth) for a service and
support prioritization of resources when necessary for that service.


The 5G system shall enable the network operator to define and
statically configure a maximum resource assignment for a specific
service that can be adjusted based on the network state (e.g. during
congestion, disaster, emergency and DDoS events) subject to regional or
national regulatory and operator policies.


The 5G system shall allow decoupling of the priority of a particular
communication from the associated QoS characteristics such as end\-to\-end
latency and reliability.


The 5G system shall be able to support a harmonised QoS and policy
framework applicable to multiple accesses.


The 5G system shall be able to support E2E (e.g. UE to UE) QoS for a
service.


NOTE 2: E2E QoS needs to consider QoS in the access networks,
backhaul, core network, and network to network interconnect.


The 5G system shall be able to support QoS for applications in a
Service Hosting Environment.


A 5G system with multiple access technologies shall be able to select
the combination of access technologies to serve an UE on the basis of
the targeted priority, pre\-emption, QoS parameters and access technology
availability.


The 5G system shall support a mechanism to determine suitable QoS
parameters for traffic over a satellite backhaul, based e.g. on the
latency and bandwidth of the specific backhaul .


NOTE 3: The case where a backhaul connection has dynamically changed
latency and/or bandwidth needs to be considered.


## 6\.8 Dynamic policy control


The 5G system shall support the creation and enforcement of
prioritisation policy for users and traffic, during connection setup and
when connected.


NOTE: Prioritisation, pre\-emption, and precedence of critical traffic
associated with certain priority services (e.g. MPS and Emergency) are
subject to regional/national regulatory and operator policies.


The 5G system shall support optimised signalling for prioritised
users and traffic where such signalling is prioritized over other
signalling traffic.


Based on operator policy, the 5G system shall allow flexible means
for authorized entities to create and enforce priority among the
different service flows.


Based on operator policy, the 5G system shall support a real\-time,
dynamic, secure and efficient means for authorized entities (e.g. users,
context aware network functionality) to modify the QoS and policy
framework. Such modifications may have a variable duration.


Based on operator policy, the 5G system shall maintain a session when
prioritization of that session changes in real time, provided that the
new priority is above the threshold for maintaining the session.


## 6\.9 Connectivity models


### 6\.9\.1 Description


The UE (remote UE) can connect to the network directly (direct
network connection), connect using another UE as a relay UE (indirect
network connection), or connect using both direct and indirect
connections. Relay UEs can be used in many different scenarios and
verticals (inHome, SmartFarming, SmartFactories, Public Safety and
others). In these cases, the use of relay UEs can be used to improve the
energy efficiency and coverage of the system.


Remote UEs can be anything from simple wearables, such as sensors
embedded in clothing, to a more sophisticated wearable UE monitoring
biometrics. They can also be non\-wearable UEs that communicate in a
Personal Area Network such as a set of home appliances (e.g. smart
thermostat and entry key), or the electronic UEs in an office setting
(e.g. smart printers), or a smart flower pot that can be remotely
activated to water the plant.


When a remote UE is attempting to establish an indirect network
connection, there might be several relay UEs that are available in
proximity and supporting selection procedures of an appropriate relay UE
among the available relay UEs is needed.


Indirect network connection covers the use of relay UEs for
connecting a remote UE to the 3GPP network. There can be one or more
relay UE(s) (more than one hop) between the network and the remote
UE.


A ProSe UE\-to\-UE Relay can also be used to connect two remote Public
Safety UEs using direct device connection. There can be one or more
ProSe UE\-to\-UE Relay(s) (more than one hop) between the two remote
Public Safety UEs.

NOTE: It does not apply to a traffic flow of a remote UE using
different indirect network connection paths.


#### 6\.9\.2\.3 Permission and
Authorization


The 5G system shall enable the network operator to authorize a UE to

## 6\.11 Context\-aware network


### 6\.11\.1 Description


A variety of sensors such as accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer,
barometer, proximity sensor, and GPS can be integrated in a UE. Also,
different applications running on the UE can have different
communication needs (e.g. different traffic time). In addition, a UE can
support different access technologies such as NR, E\-UTRA, WLAN access
technology, and fixed broadband access technology. The information
gathered by sensors, the utilized access technologies, the application
context, and the application traffic characteristics can provide useful
information to the applications installed in the UE and can also help
the 5G system utilize resources in an efficient and optimized way.


### 6\.11\.2 Requirements


The 5G system shall support network resource utilization efficiently
and network optimization based on system information, including:\-
network conditions, such as network load and congestion information;


\- information on served UEs such as access information (e.g. 3GPP
access, non\-3GPP access), cell type (e.g. macro cell, small cell), user
experienced data rate;


\- application's characteristics (e.g. expected traffic over
time);


\- information on prioritized communication such as user subscription
profile and priority level, priority services (e.g. MPS, Emergency, and
Public Safety), application used for priority communications (e.g.
voice, video, and data) and traffic associated with priority
communications (signalling and media);


\- subject to user consent, enhanced traffic characteristic of UE
(e.g. Mobility information (e.g. no mobility, nomadic, spatially
restricted mobility, full mobility), location, sensor\-level information
(e.g. direction, speed, power status, display status, other sensor
information installed in the UE), application\-level information (e.g.
foreground applications, running background application, and user
settings).


The 5G system shall support mechanisms to collect system information
for network optimization within an operator configured time scale.


## 6\.12 Self backhaul


### 6\.12\.1 Description


The increased density of access nodes needed to meet future
performance objectives poses considerable challenges in deployment and
management (e.g. backhaul availability, backhaul capacity and
scalability). The use of wireless backhaul for such access nodes helps
to address some of the challenges.


Wireless self\-backhauling in the radio access network can enable
simpler deployment and incremental rollout by reducing reliance on the
availability of wired backhaul at each access node location. Network
planning and installation efforts can be reduced by leveraging plug and
play type features \-\- self\-configuration, self\-organizing, and
self\-optimization.


### 6\.12\.2 Requirements

the wireless self\-backhaul.


NOTE 2: This is to enhance reliability and capacity and reduce
end\-to\-end latency.


## 6\.13 Flexible
broadcast/multicast service


### 6\.13\.1 Description


The proliferation of video services, ad\-hoc multicast/broadcast
streams, software delivery over wireless, group communications and
broadcast/multicast IoT applications have created a need for a flexible
and dynamic allocation of radio resources between unicast and multicast
services within the network as well as support for a stand\-alone
deployment of multicast/broadcast network. Moreover, enabling such a
service over a network for a wide range of inter\-site distances between
the radio base stations will enable a more efficient and effective
delivery system for real\-time and streaming multicast/broadcast content
over wide geographic areas as well as in specific geographic areas
spanning a limited number of base stations. A flexible
multicast/broadcast service will allow the 5G system to efficiently
deliver such services.

broadcast/multicast system over a wide geographic area in a spectrally
efficient manner for stationary and mobile UEs.


The 5G system shall enable the operator to reserve 0% to 100% of

## 6\.14 Subscription aspects


### 6\.14\.1 Description


With the Internet of Things, it is expected that the diversity of IoT
devices (e.g. sensors, UAVs, smart flower pots) and the usage models
will largely vary. Moreover, when the IoT device is manufactured, the
deployment location and specific usage might not be known. Sometimes the
IoT devices will be added to existing subscriptions, other times they
can be part of a new subscription for the user. Sometimes the IoT
devices can be leased. During their life cycle these IoT devices go
through different stages, involving the change in ownership when the IoT
device is deployed and possibly afterwards, the activation of the IoT
device by the preferred operator, a possible change of operators, etc.
These stages need to be managed securely and efficiently. A method of
dynamic subscription generation and management is needed in addition to
statically provisioned subscription. Once the subscription is
established, subscription management becomes necessary, for example, to
modify the subscription when the ownership of the IoT device changes, to
update or refresh credentials due to suspected leakage or theft of
security keys or as a preventive measure.


The Internet of Things will also support various connectivity models:
The IoT devices can connect with the network directly or connect with
the network using another IoT device as a relay UE, or they can be
capable of using both types of connections. The direct device connection
between the IoT device and the relay UE can be using 3GPP or non\-3GPP
RAT. The relay UE can access the network also using 3GPP or non\-3GPP
access networks (e.g. WLAN, fixed broadband access network). In order to
identify and manage the IoT devices, a subscription with the 5G network
is needed, even if the access is done via non\-3GPP access.


### 6\.14\.2 Requirements


An IoT device which is able to access a 5G PLMN in direct network
connection mode using a 3GPP RAT shall have a 3GPP subscription.


The 5G system shall allow the operator to identify a UE as an IoT
device based on UE characteristics (e.g. identified by an equipment
identifier or a range of equipment identifiers) or subscription or the
combination of both.


The 5G system shall be able to provide mechanisms to change the
association between a subscription and address/number of an IoT device
(e.g. changing the owner and subscription information associated with
the IoT device) within the same operator and in between different
operators in an automated or manual way.


The 5G system shall be able to support identification of
subscriptions independently of identification of IoT devices. Both
identities shall be secure.


An IoT device which is able to connect to a UE in direct device
connection mode shall have a 3GPP subscription, if the IoT device needs
to be identifiable by the core network (e.g. for IoT device management
purposes or to use indirect network connection mode).


Based on operator policy, the 5G system shall support a mechanism to
provision on\-demand connectivity (e.g. IP connectivity for remote
provisioning). This on\-demand mechanism should enable means for a user
to request on\-the\-spot network connectivity while providing operators
with identification and security tools for the provided
connectivity.


The 5G system shall support a secure mechanism for a home operator to
remotely provision the 3GPP credentials of a uniquely identifiable and
verifiably secure IoT device.


The 5G system shall support a secure mechanism for the network
operator of an NPN to remotely provision the non\-3GPP identities and
credentials of a uniquely identifiable and verifiably secure IoT
device.


Based on MNO and NPN policy, the 5G system shall support a mechanism
to enable MNO to update the subscription of an authorized UE in order to
allow the UE to connect to a desired NPN. This on\-demand mechanism
should enable means for a user to request on\-the\-spot network
connectivity which is authorized by its MNO.


Based on operator policy, the 5G system shall provide means for
authorised 3rd parties to request changes to UE subscription parameters
for access to data networks, e.g., static IP address and configuration
parameters for data network access.


## 6\.15 Energy efficiency


### 6\.15\.1 Description


Energy efficiency is a critical issue in 5G. The potential to deploy
systems in areas without a reliable energy source requires new methods
of managing energy consumption not only in the UEs but throughout all
components of the 5G system.


Small form factor UEs also typically have a small battery and this
not only puts constrains on general power optimization but also on how
the energy is consumed. With smaller batteries it is more important to
understand and follow the limitations for the both the maximum peak and
continuous current drain.


### 6\.15\.2 Requirements


The 5G access network shall support an energy saving mode with the
following characteristics:


\- the energy saving mode can be activated/deactivated either manually
or automatically;


\- service can be restricted to a group of users (e.g. public safety
user, emergency callers).


NOTE: When in energy saving mode the UE's and Access transmit power
may be reduced or turned off (deep sleep mode), end\-to\-end latency and
jitter may be increased with no impact on set of users or applications
still allowed.


The 5G system shall support mechanisms to improve battery life for a
UE over what is possible in EPS.


The 5G system shall optimize the battery consumption of a relay UE
via which a UE is in indirect network connection mode.


The 5G system shall support UEs using small rechargeable and single
coin cell batteries (e.g. considering impact on maximum pulse and
continuous current).


## 6\.15a Energy
Efficiency as a Service Criteria


### 6\.15a.1 Description


Climate change and the rising consumption of energy motivate
increased energy efficiency. Energy efficiency is a strategic priority
for telecom operators around the world.


Energy efficiency as a service criteria allows services to be
delivered with diverse energy efficiency and energy consumption
policies. Energy consumption and efficiency information and network
energy states can be exposed to third parties and energy consumption can
be constrained.


Energy related information can include ratio of renewable energy and
carbon emission information when available. Calculation of energy
related information as described in the following requirements is done
by means of averaging or applying a statistical model. The requirements
do not imply that some form of 'real time' monitoring is required.


### 6\.15a.2
Energy related information as a service criteria


#### 6\.15a.2\.1 Description


Energy consumption can be monitored and considered through O\&M as
part of network operations \[47], as well as a service criteria.


For best\-effort traffic, that is, without QoS criteria, policies can
be defined to limit energy use for services. This is not in conflict
with the principle that performance policies will not be traded off for
energy efficiency, since best\-effort service has no performance
guarantees.


Specifically, best\-effort traffic can be subject to a policy that
limits the maximum energy consumption over time, or further constrained
by location (so that the energy consumption limit only applies when used
in a specified service area.)


Additionally, policies can be defined with a maximum energy credit
limit, e.g. for best\-effort services to limit the total amount of energy
consumption according to an energy charging rate. These policies expand
the options of subscription policies to control energy consumption in
the 5G system.


#### 6\.15a.2\.2 Requirements


Subject to operator’s policy, the 5G system shall support
subscription policies that define a maximum energy credit limit for
services without QoS criteria.


Subject to operator’s policy, the 5G system shall support a means to
associate energy consumption information with charging information based
on subscription policies for services without QoS criteria.


Subject to operator’s policy, the 5G system shall support a mechanism
to perform energy consumption credit limit control for services without
QoS criteria.


NOTE 1: The result of the credit control is not specified by this
requirement.


NOTE 2: Credit control \[49] compares against a credit control limit.
It is assumed charging events are assigned a corresponding energy
consumption and this is compared against a policy of energy credit
limit. It is assumed there can be a new policy to limit energy
consumption allowed.


Subject to operator’s policy, the 5G system shall support a means to
define subscription policies and means to enforce the policy that define
a maximum energy consumption (i.e. quantity of energy for a specified
period of time) for services without QoS criteria.


NOTE 3: The granularity of the subscription policies can either apply
to the subscriber (all services), or to particular services.


The 5G system shall provide a mechanism to include Energy related
information as part of charging information.


Subject to operator policy and agreement with 3rd party, the 5G
system shall provide a mechanism to support the selection of an
application server based on energy related information associated with a
set of application servers.


Subject to user consent and operator policy, 5G system shall be able
to provide means to modify a communication service based on energy
related information criteria based on subscription policies.


Subject to user consent, operator policy and regulatory requirements,
the 5G system shall be able to provide means to operate part or the
whole network according to energy consumption requirements, which may be
based on subscription policies or requested by an authorized 3rd
party.


### 6\.15a.3 Support of
different energy states


#### 6\.15a.3\.1 Description


Different energy states is beneficial for verticals and operators to
save energy according to different working status of telecommunication
equipment and manufacturing.


#### 6\.15a.3\.2 Requirements


The 5G system shall support different energy states of network
elements and network functions.


5G system shall support dynamic changes of energy states of network
elements and network functions.


NOTE: This requirement also includes the condition when providing
network elements or functions to an authorised 3rd party, the dynamic
changes can be based on pre\-configured policy (the time of changing
energy states, which energy state map to which level of load, etc.)


The 5G system shall support different charging mechanisms based on
the different energy states of network elements and network
functions.


### 6\.15a.4 Monitoring and
measurement


#### 6\.15a.4\.1 Description


Different levels of monitoring and measurement related to energy
consumption and efficiency bring more support in energy efficiency and
energy saving. In this section, monitoring and measurement related to
energy consumption and efficiency include network functions under NPN
condition and also all kinds of NG\-RAN deployment scenarios.


#### 6\.15a.4\.2 Requirements


Subject to operator's policy, the 5G network shall support energy
consumption monitoring at per network slice and per subscriber
granularity.


NOTE 1: Energy consumption monitoring as described in the preceding
requirement is done by means of averaging or applying a statistical
model. The requirement does not imply that some form of 'real time'
monitoring is required. The granularity of the subscription policies can
either apply to the subscriber (all services), or to particular
services.


Subject to operator’s policy and agreement with 3rd party,
the 5G system shall be able to monitor energy consumption for serving
this 3rd party.


NOTE 2: The granularity of energy consumption measurement could vary
according to different situations, for example, when several services
share a same network slice, etc.


NOTE 3: The energy consumption information can be related to the
network resources of network slice, NPNs, etc.


Subject to operator policy and regulatory requirements, the 5G system
shall be able to monitor the energy consumption for serving the 3rd
party, together with the network performance statistic information for
the services provided by that network, related to same time interval
e.g. hourly or daily.


NOTE 4: The network performance statistic information could be the
data rate, packet delay and packet loss, etc.


### 6\.15a.5 Information exposure


#### 6\.15a.5\.1 Description


Information related to energy consumption and efficiency is not only
necessary for network internal optimization, but also will benefit the
service adjustment for 3rd party.


#### 6\.15a.5\.2 Requirements


Subject to operator’s policy and agreement with 3rd party, the 5G
system shall be able to expose information on energy consumption for
serving this 3rd party.


NOTE 1: Energy consumption information can include ratio of renewable
energy and carbon emission information when available. The reporting
period could be set, e.g., on monthly or yearly basis and can vary based
on location.


NOTE 2: The energy consumption information can be related to the
network resources of network slice, NPNs, etc.


Subject to operator’s policy,agreement with 3rd party and consent by
the customer, the 5G system shall be able to expose the network
performance statistic information (e.g. the data rate, packet delay and
packet loss) together with energy consumption information resulting from
service provided to the customer, to the authorized third party, related
to the same time interval e.g. hourly or daily.


Subject to operator’s policy, the 5G system shall support a means to
expose energy consumption to authorized third parties for services,
including energy consumption information related to the condition of
energy credit limit (e.g. when the energy consumption is reaching the
energy credit limit).


Subject to operator policy, the 5G system shall provide means for the
trusted 3rd party, to configure which network performance statistic
information (e.g. the data rate, packet delay and packet loss) for the
communication service provided to the 3rd party, needs to be exposed
along with the information on energy consumption for serving this 3rd
party.


Based on operator’s policy and agreement with 3rd party, the 5G
system shall be able to expose energy consumption information and
prediction on energy consumption of the 5G network per application
service to the 3rd party.


Subject to operator’s policy and agreement with 3rd party, the 5G
system shall support a mechanism for the 3rd party to provide current or
predicted energy consumption information over a specific period of
time.


### 6\.15a.6
Network actions leveraging energy efficiency as a service criteria


#### 6\.15a.6\.1 Description


This clause addresses requirements to the 5G system that leverage
energy\-related information (e.g., energy consumption, energy
efficiency), amongst others (e.g., network load), as criteria for
network internal optimization actions targeting energy savings, within
and across operators in a localized (i.e., geographically bound) and/or
temporal (i.e., time bound) manner.


One of the strategies to save energy within mobile networks is to
shut down some RAN nodes at times of low usage.


Eventually only one communication service could be used on a local
basis among operators at times of low usage, as further energy saving
gain to be exploited. Agreements could be put in place between operators
so that in the low load periods (e.g., nighttime) only one of multiple
mobile networks may be active in an area and will provide communication
service to the subscribers of all networks, whereas the other networks
can apply cell shutdown of their own infrastructure to obtain network
energy savings.


Alternatively, based on risks of power outage
nation\-wide/region\-wide, regulators could ask operators to “optimize”
their coverage e.g., shutdown some nodes in overlapping coverage areas
during energy peak hours and/or in specific geographical areas, whilst
still guaranteeing minimum coverage/service (in particular to fullfill
regulatory requirements for services such as emergency calls, PWS, MPS
and MCS).


This can also apply between NPN operators and/or with PLMN
operators.


#### 6\.15a.6\.2 Requirements


Subject to regulatory requirements and operators’ policies, the 5G
system shall enable an operator to temporarily serve UEs of other
operators within a geographical area for the purpose of saving energy of
the other operators.


NOTE 1: The other operators are assumed to stop providing access to
their own network infrastructure within the same geographical area to
save energy during that time.


NOTE 2: Policies may include predefined times/locations, energy
consumption/efficiency thresholds, etc.


NOTE 3: It is assumed that the 5G system can collect charging
information associated with serving UEs of other operators.


## 6\.16 Markets requiring
minimal service levels


### 6\.16\.1 Description


A key aspect of 5G system flexibility is the ability to support both
the very high\-end markets as well as very low\-end markets. Some systems
will be deployed in areas where there are constraints on energy
resources (e.g. sporadic access to power) and lower end user
expectations for availability, reliability, and data rates. In such
cases, the system needs additional flexibility to adapt power
consumption needs based on fluctuations in power availability. The
system should be efficient in order to provide essential services in
harsh environments (e.g. far remote rural areas, very large territories)
while taking into account the local constraints (adapting resources
consumptions to long distances, dealing with variable conditions and
possibly disconnections). Content delivery should be optimized in order
to reduce constraints on transport networks, on low\-end UEs (e.g. small
screen, limited energy consumption), variable network conditions, and
client profiles.


### 6\.16\.2 Requirements


In constrained circumstances (e.g. reduced power supply), the 5G
system shall be able to support a minimal user experience (e.g. user
experienced data rate of \[100] kbit/s, E2E latency of 50 ms, lower
availability of the network of 95%).


The 5G system shall support centralized automation and management of
the network in order to reduce local management tasks.


The 5G system shall support a mechanism to reduce data transfer rate
at the cell edge for very large coverage area (e.g. 100 kbit/s for more
than 100 km cell coverage, 1 Mbit/s for 100 km cell coverage).


The 5G system shall be able to give priority to services (e.g.
e\-Health) when resources are limited.


## 6\.17 Extreme
long range coverage in low density areas


### 6\.17\.1 Description


A fully connected society is expected in the near future. The network
access everywhere over long distances (e.g. at remote rural areas or at
sea) including both humans and machines need to be supported.


### 6\.17\.2 Requirements


The 5G system shall support the extreme long\-range coverage (up to
100 km) in low density areas (up to 2 user/km2).


The 5G system shall support a minimum user throughput of 1 Mbit/s on
DL and 100 kbit/s on UL at the edge of coverage.


The 5G system shall support a minimum cell throughput capacity of 10
Mbit/s/cell on DL (based on an assumption of 1 GB/month/sub).


The 5G system shall support a maximum of \[400] ms E2E latency for
voice services at the edge of coverage.


## 6\.18
Multi\-network connectivity and service delivery across operators


### 6\.18\.1 Description


Given the multitude of use cases for new verticals and services, each
operator, based on its business model, can deploy a network serving only
a subset of the vertical industries and services. However, this should
not prevent an end\-user from accessing all new services and capabilities
that will be accessible via 5G systems. To provide a better user
experience for their subscribers with UEs capable of simultaneous
network access, network operators could contemplate a variety of sharing
business models and partnership with other network and service providers
to enable its subscribers to access all services via multiple networks
simultaneously, and with minimum interruption when moving.


### 6\.18\.2 Requirements


The 5G system shall enable users to obtain services from more than
one network simultaneously on an on\-demand basis.


For a user with a single operator subscription, the use of multiple
serving networks operated by different operators shall be under the
control of the home operator.


When a service is offered by multiple operators, the 5G system shall
be able to maintain service continuity with minimum service interruption
when the serving network is changed to a different serving network
operated by a different operator.


NOTE 1: A business agreement is required between the network
operators.


In the event of the same service being offered by multiple operators,
unless directed by the home operator's network, the UE shall be
prioritized to receive subscribed services from the home operator's
network.


NOTE 2: If the service is unavailable (e.g. due to lack of network
coverage) from the home operator's network, the UE may be able to
receive the service from another operator's network.


NOTE 3: QoS provided by the partner operator's network for the same
service will be based on the agreement between the two operators and
could be different than that provided by the home operator's
network.


## 6\.19 3GPP access network
selection


### 6\.19\.1 Description


The 5G system will support the concept of "network slices" where
different NG\-RANs potentially are connected to network slices of
different SSTs. A 5G UE can provide assistance information (e.g. SST) to
enable the network to select one or more network slices. A 5G system is
foreseen to support one or more SSTs, but possibly not all existing
SSTs.


A 5G network operator controls and is responsible for what SSTs that
should be available to a specific UE and subscription combination, based
on associated subscription type, network operator policies, network
capabilities and UE capabilities. The network operator can populate the
Operator Controlled PLMN Selector list with associated access technology
identifiers, stored in the 5G UE, with the PLMN/RAT combinations
enabling access to the SSTs that are available to the 5G UE with
associated subscription.


The UE uses the list of PLMN/RAT combinations for PLMN selection, if
available, typically during roaming situations. In non\-roaming
situations, the UE and subscription combination typically matches the
HPLMN/EHPLMN capabilities and policies, from a SST perspective. That is,
a 5G UE accessing its HPLMN/EHPLMN should be able to access SSTs
according to UE capabilities and the related subscription.


Optionally, a 5G system supports, subject to operator policies, a
User Controlled PLMN Selector list that enables the 5G UE user to
specify preferred PLMNs with associated access technology identifier in
priority order. The user can obtain information about suitable PLMN/RAT
combination that would support services preferred by the user.


### 6\.19\.2 Requirements


The following set of requirements complement the requirements listed
in 3GPP TS 22\.011 \[3], clause 3\.2\.


The 5G system shall support selection among any available PLMN/RAT
combinations, identified through their respective PLMN identifier and
Radio Access Technology identifier, in a prioritised order. The priority
order may, subject to operator policies, be provisioned in an Operator
Controlled PLMN Selector lists with associated RAT identifiers, stored
in the 5G UE.


The 5G system shall support, subject to operator policies, a User
Controlled PLMN Selector list stored in the 5G UE, allowing the UE user
to specify preferred PLMNs with associated RAT identifier in priority
order.


## 6\.20 eV2X aspects


### 6\.20\.1 Description


The 3GPP system is expected to support various enhanced V2X
scenarios.


Vehicles Platooning enables the vehicles to dynamically form a group
travelling together. All the vehicles in the platoon receive periodic
data from the leading vehicle, in order to carry on platoon operations.
This information allows the distance between vehicles to become
extremely small, i.e. the gap distance translated to time can be very
low (sub second). Platooning applications can allow the vehicles
following to be autonomously driven.


Advanced Driving enables semi\-automated or fully\-automated driving.
Longer inter\-vehicle distance is assumed. Each vehicle and/or RSU shares
data obtained from its local sensors with vehicles in proximity, thus
allowing vehicles to coordinate their trajectories or manoeuvres. In
addition, each vehicle shares its driving intention with vehicles in
proximity. The benefits of this use case group are safer traveling,
collision avoidance, and improved traffic efficiency.


Extended Sensors enables the exchange of raw or processed data
gathered through local sensors or live video data among vehicles, Road
Site Units, UEs of pedestrians and V2X application servers. The vehicles
can enhance the perception of their environment beyond what their own
sensors can detect and have a more holistic view of the local
situation.


Remote Driving enables a remote driver or a V2X application to
operate a remote vehicle for those passengers who cannot drive
themselves or a remote vehicle located in dangerous environments. For a
case where variation is limited and routes are predictable, such as
public transportation, driving based on cloud computing can be used. In
addition, access to cloud\-based back\-end service platform can be
considered for this use case group.


### 6\.20\.2 Requirements


The 3GPP system supports the transport of messages with different
performance requirements to support V2X scenarios. The associated
requirements are described in eV2X 3GPP TS 22\.186 \[9].


## 6\.21 NG\-RAN Sharing


### 6\.21\.1 Description


The increased density of access nodes needed to meet future
performance objectives poses considerable challenges in deployment and
acquiring spectrum and antenna locations. RAN sharing is seen as a
technical solution to these issues.


In RAN Sharing operations, NG\-RAN resources can be used by multiple
network operators. For the NG\-RAN resources deployed onboard satellites,
they can be used by both satellite mobile network operators and
terrestrial network operators together by proper network operations.
Indirect Network Sharing is one of the possible sharing methods.


In addition, Indirect Network Sharing can offer more options for an
operator to provide services to UEs via Shared NG\-RAN, when a Disaster
Condition occurs in a geographic area, which causes the loss of its UEs’
previous network connection, until the Disaster Condition is not
applicable anymore.


NOTE: This scenario assumes that NG\-RAN and/or core network of at
least one operator is unavailable but that the NG\-RAN and core network
of at least another operator is available in the disaster area. In case
the affected operator has multiple core networks in different geographic
areas, when a core network of that operator has broken down in the
specific disaster area, the other core network from the different area
can be used temporarily in this case.


During NG\-RAN sharing, the security and privacy of shared networks,
non\-shared networks, and subscribers need to be maintained without
negative effects. Especially in the case of Indirect Network Sharing,
where the involvement of the core network of the hosting operator e.g.
for signalling exchange between the users and the core network of the
participating operator could cause exposure of the subscriber’s
information to the hosting network, an extra scrutiny of the security
mechanism is expected to avoid sharing the information that is not
needed for the Indirect Network Sharing operation (e.g. network
topology) and protect the information that is needed for the Indirect
Network Sharing operation between the hosting operator and the
participating operator.


### 6\.21\.2 Requirements


#### 6\.21\.2\.1 General


Requirements related to NG\-RAN sharing are described in 3GPP TS
22\.101 \[6], mainly in clause 28\.2\.


A 5G satellite access network shall support NG\-RAN sharing.


#### 6\.21\.2\.2 Indirect network sharing

UE.


NOTE 2: For more information on Indirect Network Sharing see Annex
I.


Indirect Network Sharing shall be transparent to the user.


NOTE 3: This requirement is aligned with the existing requirement in
3GPP TS 22\.101 \[6] clause 4\.9\.

sharing in 3GPP TS 22\.101 \[6] are applied to Indirect Network
Sharing:


\- clause 4\.2\.1,


\- clause 28\.2\.3, and


\- clause 28\.2\.5\.


Subject to regulatory requirements or operator policy, the 5G network
shall support a PLMN operator to be made aware of the failure or

when the Disaster Condition applies, or when the Disaster Condition is
not applicable anymore.


Subject to regulatory requirements or operator policy, the 5G network
shall support a PLMN operator to be made aware of the availability of
other PLMN(s) as Hosting NG\-RAN Operator(s) via Indirect Network Sharing
in the same area when the Disaster Condition applies.


Subject to the agreement between the hosting and participating
operator, the 5G system shall support a means to


enable a UE of the Participating NG\-RAN Operator to:


\- access their subscribed PLMN services when accessing a Shared
NG\-RAN, and/or,


\- obtain its subscribed services, including Hosted Services, of
participating operator via a Shared NG\-RAN.


NOTE 4: The above requirement is applicable to Disaster Condition via
a Shared NG\-RAN.


Based on operator policy, the 5G system shall support a mechanism to
enable an authorized UE with a subscription to a Participating Operator
to select and access a Shared NG\-RAN.


Based on operator policy, the 5G system shall support access control
for an authorized UE accessing a Shared NG\-RAN and be able to apply
differentiated access control for different Shared NG\-RANs when more
than one Shared NG\-RAN are available for the Participating Operator to
choose from.


Based on operator policy, the 5G network shall be able to apply
differentiated access control for an authorized UE connecting to
Participating Operator’s core network e.g. depending on specifc
geographic areas within the coverage of a shared satellite NG\-RAN.


Based on operator policy, the 5G network shall minimize network

## 6\.22 Unified access control


### 6\.22\.1 Description


Depending on operator's policies, deployment scenarios, subscriber
profiles, and available services, different criterion will be used in
determining which access attempt should be allowed or blocked when
congestion occurs in the 5G System. These different criteria for access
control are associated with Access Identities and Access Categories. The
5G system will provide a single unified access control where operators
control accesses based on these two.


In unified access control, each access attempt is categorized into
one or more of the Access Identities and one of the Access Categories.
Based on the access control information applicable for the corresponding
Access Identity and Access Category of the access attempt, the UE
performs a test whether the actual access attempt can be made or
not.


The unified access control supports extensibility to allow inclusion
of additional standardized Access Identities and Access Categories and
supports flexibility to allow operators to define operator\-defined
Access Categories using their own criterion (e.g. network slicing,
application, and application server).


NOTE: Clauses 4\.1 through 4\.4a of TS 22\.011 are obsolete and replaced
by clause 6\.22\.2 of this specification. However, when a UE is configured
for EAB according to TS 22\.011, the UE is also configured for delay
tolerant service for 5G system.


### 6\.22\.2 Requirements


#### 6\.22\.2\.1 General


Based on operator policy, the 5G system shall be able to prevent UEs
from accessing the network using relevant barring parameters that vary
depending on Access Identity and Access Category. Access Identities are
configured at the UE as listed in Table 6\.22\.2\.2\-1\. Access Categories
are defined by the combination of conditions related to UE and the type
of access attempt as listed in Table 6\.22\.2\.3\-1\. One or more Access
Identities and only one Access Category are selected and tested for an
access attempt.


The 5G network shall be able to broadcast barring control information
(i.e. a list of barring parameters associated with an Access Identity
and an Access Category) in one or more areas of the RAN.


The UE shall be able to determine whether or not a particular new
access attempt is allowed based on barring parameters that the UE
receives from the broadcast barring control information and the
configuration in the UE.


In the case of multiple core networks sharing the same RAN, the RAN
shall be able to apply access control for the different core networks
individually.


The unified access control framework shall be applicable both to UEs
accessing the 5G CN using E\-UTRA and to UEs accessing the 5G CN using
NR.


The unified access control framework shall be applicable to UEs in
RRC Idle, RRC Inactive, and RRC Connected at the time of initiating a
new access attempt (e.g. new session request).


NOTE 1: "new session request" in RRC Connected refers to events, e.g.
new MMTEL voice or video session, sending of SMS (SMS over IP, or SMS
over NAS), sending of IMS registration related signalling, new PDU
session establishment, existing PDU session modification, and service
request to re\-establish the user plane for an existing PDU session.


The 5G system shall support means by which the operator can define
operator\-defined Access Categories to be mutually exclusive.


NOTE 2: Examples of criterion of operator\-defined Access Categories
are network slicing, application, and application server.


The unified access control framework shall be applicable to inbound
roamers to a PLMN.


The serving PLMN should be able to provide the definition of
operator\-defined Access Categories to the UE.

The PLMNs where the configuration is valid are HPLMN or PLMNs equivalent to HPLMN and visited PLMNs of the home country. Access Identity 2 is also valid when the UE is explicitly authorized by the network based on specific configured PLMNs inside and outside the home country. NOTE 3: Access Identities 11 and 15 are valid in Home PLMN only if the EHPLMN list is not present or in any EHPLMN. Access Identities 12, 13 and 14 are valid in Home PLMN and visited PLMNs of home country only. For this purpose, the home country is defined as the country of the MCC part of the IMSI. NOTE 4: The configuration is valid for PLMNs that indicate to potential Disaster Inbound Roamers that the UEs can access the PLMN. See clause 6\.31\. | |


Any number of these Access Identities may be barred at any one
time.

When a UE is configured for EAB, the UE is also configured for delay tolerant service. In case a UE is configured both for EAB and for EAB override, when upper layer indicates to override Access Category 1, then Access Category 1 is not applicable. NOTE 2: When there are an Access Category based on operator classification and a standardized Access Category to both of which an access attempt can be categorized, and the standardized Access Category is neither 0 nor 2, the UE applies the Access Category based on operator classification.

NOTE 3: Includes Real\-Time Text (RTT). NOTE 4: Includes IMS Messaging. NOTE 5: Includes IMS registration related signalling, e.g. IMS initial registration, re\-registration, and subscription refresh. NOTE 6: Applies to access of a NB\-IoT\-capable UEto a NB\-IOT cell connected to 5GC when the UE is authorized to send exception data. | | |

## 6\.23 QoS monitoring


### 6\.23\.1 Description


The QoS requirements specified for particular services such as URLLC
services, vertical automation communication services, and V2X, mandate
QoS guarantees from the network. However, the network cannot always
guarantee the required QoS of the service. An example reason for this
shortcoming is that the latency and/or packet error rate increase due to
interference in a radio cell. In such cases, it is critical that the
application and/or application server is notified in a timely manner.
Hence, the 5G system should be able to support QoS monitoring/assurance
for URLLC services, V2X and vertical automation.


For more information on QoS assurance see Annex F.


Vertical automation systems are locally distributed and are typically
served by wired and wireless communication networks of different types
and with different characteristics. If the operation of the system or
one of its sub\-processes does not work properly, there is a need for
quickly finding and eliminating the related error or fault in order to
avoid significant operation and thus financial losses. To that end,
automation devices and applications implement diagnosis and
error\-analysis algorithms, as well as predictive maintenance
features.


Due to their inherent challenges, wireless communication systems are
usually under suspicion in case an error occurs in a distributed
automation application. Therefore, diagnosis and fault analysis features
for 5G systems are required. The 5G system needs to provide sufficient
monitoring information as input for such diagnosis features.


QoS monitoring can be used for the following activities:


\- assessing and assuring the dependability of network operation;


\- assessing and assuring the dependability of the communication
services;


\- excluding particular communication errors;


\- identifying communication errors;


\- analysing the location of an error including the geographic
location of the involved network component (UE; front\-haul component;
core node);


\- activation of application\-related countermeasures.


This section provides requirements for both functionality and service
exposure. In addition, the service exposure requirements on QoS
monitoring in 22\.101 \[6], clause 29\.2 apply.


### 6\.23\.2 Requirements


The 5G system shall provide a mechanism for supporting real\-time E2E
QoS monitoring within a system.


NOTE 1: The end points in E2E are the termination points of the
communication service within the boundary of the 5G system.


The 5G system shall support combined QoS monitoring for a group of
UEs.


NOTE 1A: Combined monitoring stands for the monitoring of several UEs
for which the monitoring results are reported together. An example for
combined QoS monitoring is that the 5G networks monitors the service bit
rates of all connections associated with the group of UEs.


The 5G network shall provide an interface to an application for QoS
monitoring (e.g. to initiate QoS monitoring, request QoS parameters,
events, logging information).


The 5G system shall be able to provide real time QoS parameters and
events information to an authorized application/network entity.


NOTE 2: The QoS parameters to be monitored and reported can include
latency (e.g. UL/DL or round trip), jitter, and packet loss rate.


The 5G system shall be able to log the history of the communication
events.


NOTE 3: The communication history may include timestamps of
communication events and position\-related information. Examples of such
information are the positions of UEs and of radio base stations
associated with communication events. Communication events include
instances when the required QoS is not met.


The 5G system shall support different levels of granularity for QoS
monitoring (e.g. per flow or set of flows).


The 5G system shall be able to provide event notification upon
detecting an error that the negotiated QoS level cannot be
met/guaranteed.


The 5G system shall be able to provide information that identifies
the type and the location of a communication error (e.g. cell ID).


The 5G system shall be able to provide notification of communication
events to authorized entities per pre\-defined patterns.


NOTE 4: An example for a communication event is that the service bit
rate drops below a pre\-defined threshold for QoS parameters. When such
an event occurs, the authorized entity is notified, and the event is
logged.


The 5G system shall support event\-based QoS monitoring.


NOTE 5: An example for a triggering event is a position change of the
pertinent UE. A position change can, for instance, be inferred from a 5G
position service that tracks the UE.


The 5G system shall be able to respond to a request from an
authorized entity to provide real\-time QoS monitoring information within
a specified time after receiving the request (e.g., within 5 s).


NOTE 6: The response time can be specified by the user.


The 5G system shall support real time QoS monitoring with a specified
update/refresh rate.


NOTE 6a: The update/refresh rate can be specified by the user.


NOTE 6b: The update/refresh rates for QoS monitoring measurements and
reporting can be different.


The 5G system shall be able to provide statistical information of
service parameters and error types while a communication service is in
operation.


NOTE 7: The time span for collection and evaluation of statistical
values can be specified by the user.


The 5G system shall provide information on the current availability
of a specific communication service in a particular area (e.g. cell ID)
upon request of an authorized entity.


The 5G system shall provide a means by which an MNO informs a third
party of network events (failure of network infrastructure affecting UEs
in a particular area, etc.).


Based on MNO policy, the 5G system shall provide a mechanism
to automatically report service degradations, communications loss, and
sustained connection loss in a specific geographic area (e.g., a cell
sector, a cell or a group of cells) to a third party. 


NOTE 8: These reports use a standard format. The specific values,
thresholds, and conditions upon which alarms occur can include the
measured values for end\-to\-end latency, service bit rate, communication
service availability, end\-to\-end latency jitter, etc. for a UE, the UE’s
location, and the time(s) during which the degradation occurred.


The 5G system shall provide a mechanism for an authorised third party
to report to an MNO service degradations, communication loss, and
sustained connection loss.


NOTE 9: These reports use a standard format. The specific values,
thresholds, and conditions upon which alarms occur can include the
measured values for end\-to\-end latency, service bit rate, communication
service availability, end\-to\-end latency jitter, etc. for a UE, the UE’s
location, and the time(s) during which the degradation occurred.


NOTE 10: What the MNO does with such reports is out of scope of
3GPP.


Based on operator request, for direct network connection scenarios in
non\-public networks, the 5G system shall be able to activate/deactivate
efficient QoS monitoring with a finer granularity (e.g. per data packet)
in a specific QoS flow (e.g. supporting URLLC services) to report on
data packets not meeting the required QoS level.


NOTE 11: The QoS parameters to be monitored and reported can include
latency (e.g. UL or DL).


NOTE 12: The above requirement does not assume UE impacts.


Subject to user
consent, the 5G network shall provide suitable means for an authorized
3rd party to provided E2E QoS parameters for a service.


## 6\.24 Ethernet transport
services


### 6\.24\.1 Description


This clause includes common, fundamental Ethernet transport
requirements, and any requirements necessary to support a 5G LAN\-type
service. The requirements applicable to the 5G system for supporting

(e.g. RSTP, MSTP \[54]).


## 6\.25 Non\-public networks


### 6\.25\.1 Description


Non\-public networks are intended for the sole use of a private entity
such as an enterprise, and can be deployed in a variety of
configurations, utilising both virtual and physical elements.
Specifically, they can be deployed as completely standalone networks,
they can be hosted by a PLMN, or they can be offered as a slice of a
PLMN.


In any of these deployment options, it is expected that unauthorized
UEs, those that are not associated with the enterprise, will not attempt
to access the non\-public network, which could result in resources being
used to reject that UE and thereby not be available for the UEs of the
enterprise. It is also expected that UEs of the enterprise will not
attempt to access a network they are not authorized to access. For
example, some enterprise UEs can be restricted to only access the
non\-public network of the enterprise, even if PLMN coverage is available
in the same geographic area. Other enterprise UEs can access both a
non\-public network and a PLMN where specifically allowed.


In addition to the requirements in this section, all requirements and
KPIs in other sections of TS 22\.261, that are not exclusively for PLMNs
(i.e. explicitly using the term PLMN) also apply to (i.e. are in scope
of) non\-public networks, except the requirements in sections 5\.1, 6\.2\.4
and 6\.3\.2\.2\. However, hereby it is important to realize that
requirements and features are optional to be supported by a non\-public
network, since non\-public network deployments can include different
subsets of 5G system requirements and services described in the sections
of TS 22\.261\. The deployment choices are dependent on verticals needs
and regulation.


### 6\.25\.2 Requirements


The 5G system shall support non\-public networks.


The 5G system shall support non\-public networks that provide coverage
within a specific geographic area.


The 5G system shall support both physical and virtual non\-public
networks.

services, 5G system shall be able to support IMS emergency services for
non\-public networks.

may display for manual selection of a non\-public network.


The 5G system shall support a change of host of a non\-public network
from one PLMN to another PLMN without changing the network selection
information stored in the UEs of the non\-public network.


The 5G system shall enable an NPN to support multiple third\-party
service providers.


In the event of a loss of communication between RAN and core network,
the 5G system shall be able to provide capability to securely re\-connect
an NPN network function within a short period of time (\< 1s).


### 6\.25\.3 Groups of interconnected
SNPNs


A group of interconnected SNPNs consists of one of more pairs of
interconnected SNPNs. The determination of whether a given SNPN can or
should be able to participate within a given group of interconnected
SNPNs if based on prior arrangement and out of band configuration. How
these arrangements and configuration are made is outside the scope of
3GPP and the 5G network.

scope for this functionality.


Based on the SNPN configuration, the 5G network shall support a

and remove 5G LAN\-VN including their related functionality (subscription
data, routing and addressing functionality).


The 5G network shall enable the network operator to add one or more

The 5G system shall enable the network operator to configure a 5G
LAN\-VN that is available only within a geographical area.


Based on MNO policy, the 5G network shall provide suitable means to
allow an authorised third party to


\- monitor changes in QoS policy that pertains to LAN\-VN
performance;


\- configure and receive information regarding the achieved
performance for a specific UE;


\- configure and receive information regarding the achieved
performance for a specific network (e.g, number of active UEs, UE status
(connection status) change events in 5G LAN\-VN);


\- receive notification of changes in specific configuration aspects
of the UE in the VN (e.g., changes in group membership information.)

home setting (from sensors to video streaming, relatively low amount of
UEs per group, many devices are used only occasionally) for 5G LAN\-type
service.


The 5G system shall support traffic scenarios typically found in an
office setting (from sensors to very high data rates e.g. for
conferencing, medium amount of UEs per group) for 5G LAN\-type
service.


The 5G system shall support traffic scenarios typically found in an
industrial setting (from sensors to remote control, large amount of UEs

packets transferred between remote UE and relay UE if they are using
3GPP access).


The 5G network shall be able to support service continuity for the
private communication between a remote UE with other member UEs of the
same 5G LAN\-VN, when the remote UE changes from one relay UE to another
or when the UE changes between direct and indirect network
connection.


#### 6\.26\.2\.9 Service exposure

## 6\.27 Positioning services


### 6\.27\.1 Description


5G positioning services aims to support verticals and applications
with positioning accuracies better than 10 meters, thus more accurate
than the ones of TS 22\.071 \[24] for LCS. High accuracy positioning is
characterized by ambitious system requirements for positioning accuracy
in many verticals and applications, including regulatory needs.


In Location\-Based\-Services and eHealth, higher accuracy is
instrumental to new services and applications, both outdoor and
indoor.


For example, on the factory floor, it is important to locate assets
and moving objects such as forklifts, or parts to be assembled. Similar
needs exist in transportation and logistics, for example rail, road and
use of UAVs. In some road user cases, UE's supporting V2X application(s)
are also applicable to such needs. In cases such as guided vehicles
(e.g. industry, UAVs) and positioning of objects involved in
safety\-related functions, availability needs to be very high.


Mission Critical Organizations require mission critical services to
have accurate positioning such that first responders can be located at
all times during normal and critical operations, indoors as well as
outdoors. The level of positioning accuracy (and other KPIs) required is
much more stringent than that required by local and regional regulatory
requirements for commercial 5G users.


Based on MNO policy, the 5G network shall provide suitable APIs to
allow a trusted third\-party to dynamically adjust partial configuration
(i.e. create, manage, and remove) of the 5G LANs for the authorized 5G
LAN\-VN capable UEs.


NOTE: 5G LAN\-VN capable UEs means the operator authorizes UEs to use
5G LAN\-type service. The joining to the 5G LAN\-VN group and the
configuration to the 5G LAN\-VN can be dynamically configured by an
trusted third party.


### 6\.27\.2 Requirements


The 5G system shall provide 5G positioning services in compliance
with regulatory requirements.


NOTE 1: example of regulatory requirements encompasses requirements
on emergency calls (e.g. e911\), reliability and safety requirement
(RAMS) applicable to some use cases and verticals, implementation of
Priority, Precedence, Preemption (PPP) mechanisms to ensure sufficient
reliability metrics are reached.


The 5G system shall provide different 5G positioning services,
supported by different single and hybrid positioning methods to supply
absolute and relative positioning.


NOTE 2: hybrid positioning methods include both the combination of
3GPP positioning technologies and the combination of 3GPP positioning
technologies with non\-3GPP positioning technologies such as, GNSS (e.g.
Beidou, Galileo, GPS, Glonass), Network\-based Assisted GNSS and
High\-Accuracy GNSS, Terrestrial Beacon Systems, dead\-reckoning sensors
(e.g. IMU, barometer), WLAN/Bluetooth\-based positioning.


The 5G system shall enable an MCX UE to use the 5G positioning
services to determine its position with the associated
uncertainty/confidence of the position, on request, triggered by an
event or periodically.


The 5G System shall be able to provide the 5G positioning services in
case of roaming.


The 5G system shall support mechanisms to determine the UE’s
position\-related data for period when the UE is outside the coverage of
3GPP RAT\-dependent positioning technologies but within the 5G
positioning service area (e.g. within the coverage of satellite
access).


The 5G system shall be able to make the position\-related data
available to an application or to an application server existing within
the 5G network, external to the 5G network, or in the User
Equipment.


NOTE 3: the position service latency can be tailored to the use
cases.


The 5G system shall be able to manage and log position\-related data
in compliance with applicable traceability, authentication and security
regulatory requirements.


The 5G network shall be able to request the UE to provide its
position\-related\-data on request—together with the accuracy of its
position—triggered by an event or periodically and to request the UE to
stop providing its position\-related data periodically.


NOTE 4: This requirement does not preclude whether the position is
computed in the UE or elsewhere in the 5G System (e.g. core
network).


The 5G system shall support mechanisms to configure dynamically the
update rate of the position\-related data to fulfil different
performances (e.g. power consumption, position service latency) or
different location modes.


NOTE 5: for example, the 5G System needs to be able to request the UE
to provide its location periodically with an update rate ranging from
one location every \[1 s to 10 s] in location normal mode to one location
every \[30 s to 300 s, or more] in location power saving mode. The 5G
System needs to allow UEs to sleep for extended periods (e.g. one week),
without requiring the UE to update its position data.


The 5G system shall allow the UE to trigger a different update rate
of the position\-related data based on whether the UE is moving or
not.


The 5G system shall be able to determine the position\-related data of
the 5G positioning services with any update rate ranging from one set of
position\-related data every 0,1 s to one set of position\-related data
every month.


NOTE 6: the position service latency can be tailored to the use
cases.


The 5G System shall be able to negotiate the positioning methods
according to the operator's policy or the application’s requirements or
the user's preferences and shall support mechanisms to allow the network
or the UE to trigger this negotiation.


The 5G system shall supply a method for the operator to configure and
manage different positioning services for different users.


The 5G system shall be able to determine the reliability, and the
uncertainty or confidence level, of the position\-related data.


The 5G system shall be able to access to the positioning methods used
for calculating the position\-related data and to the associated
uncertainty/confidence indicators.


## 6\.28
Cyber\-physical control applications in vertical domains


### 6\.28\.1 Description


The 5G system is expected to meet the service requirements for
cyber\-physical control applications in vertical domains.


A vertical domain is a particular industry or group of enterprises in
which similar products or services are developed, produced, and
provided. Automation refers to the control of processes, devices, or
systems in vertical domains by automatic means. The main control
functions of automated control systems include taking measurements,
comparing results, computing any detected or anticipated errors, and
correcting the process to avoid future errors. These functions are
performed by sensors, transmitters, controllers, and actuators.


Cyber\-physical systems are to be understood as systems that include
engineered, interacting networks of physical and computational
components. Cyber\-physical control applications are to be understood as
applications that control physical processes. Cyber\-physical control
applications in automation follow certain activity patterns, which are
open\-loop control, closed\-loop control, sequence control, and batch
control.


Communication services supporting cyber\-physical control applications
need to be ultra\-reliable, dependable with a high communication service
availability, and often require low or (in some cases) very low
end\-to\-end latency.


Communication in automation in vertical domains follows certain
communication patterns. The most well\-known is periodic deterministic
communication, others are a\-periodic deterministic communication and
Smart Grid.


Smart Grid is a term that refers to enhanced cyber\-physical control
of electrical grids and to related application. Smart Grid operation can
cover power generation, transmission, distribution, and consumption,
which can require high communication service availability and
communication service reliability, and in some cases a low end\-to\-end
latency with more accurate clock synchronization. 5G system
functionalities can be used for Smart Grid control, monitoring,
availability assurance, service security, isolation and
etc.Communication for cyber\-physical control applications supports
operation in various vertical domains, for instance industrial
automation and energy automation.


For more information about cyber\-physical control applications in
specific vertical domains, see clauses D.1 to D.4\.


### 6\.28\.2 Requirements


#### 6\.28\.2\.1 General


The 5G system supports the communication services for cyber\-physical
control applications in the vertical domains of factories of the future
(smart manufacturing), electric power distribution, smart grid, central
power generation, and rail\-bound mass transit. The associated
requirements are described in 3GPP TS 22\.104 \[21].


#### 6\.28\.2\.2 Smart Grid


For the 5G system to support the Smart Grid, the 5G systems needs to
fulfil at minimum the following requirements.


\- 3GPP TS 22\.104 clauses 5\.2, 5\.3, and 5\.6 for requirements related
to periodic communication, aperiodic communication, and clock
synchronization;


\- 3GPP TS22\.104, clause 5\.6\.1, 5\.6C, 9 and A.4 for Smart Grid
specific service requirements;


\- 3GPP TS 22\.261, clauses 6\.10, 6\.13, 6\.14, and 6\.26 for requirements
related to the support of secured communication between the 5G system
and a trusted third\-party;


\- 3GPP TS 22\.261, clauses 6\.23 for the requirements related to
information exchange between the 5G system and a trusted
third\-party;


\- 3GPP TS 22\.261, clause 8\.9 for the requirements on security.


## 6\.29 Messaging aspects


### 6\.29\.1 Description


The 5G system is expected to support advanced capabilities and
performance of messaging service especially for massive IoT
communication which are introduced by the MSGin5G Service \[22]. The
MSGin5G Service provides one to one, group and broadcast message
services for thing\-to\-thing and person\-to\-thing communication with low
end\-to\-end latency and high reliability of message delivery, in a
resource efficient manner to optimize the resource usage of the both
control plane and user plane in the network, and power saving in the
user devices.


### 6\.29\.2 Requirements


The 5G system supports the MSGin5G Service. The associated service
level requirements of the MSGin5G Service are described in 3GPP TS
22\.262 \[22].


## 6\.30 Steering of roaming


### 6\.30\.1 Description


Steering of roaming allows the HPLMN (or subscribed NPN) to steer a
UE to a VPLMN or NPN on which the HPLMN (or subscribed NPN) wants the UE
to register, when the UE registers on another VPLMN or NPN. This
capability can be needed for reasons e.g. reselection to a higher
priority PLMN, or NPNs, based on business arrangements.


### 6\.30\.2 Requirements


The following set of requirements complement the requirements listed
in 3GPP TS 22\.011 \[3], clause 3\.2\.2\.8\.


The 5G system shall support a mechanism for the HPLMN to control the
timing when a UE registered on a VPLMN, in automatic mode (see clause
3\.1 of TS 23\.122 \[25]) and currently in CONNECTED mode, enters IDLE mode
and initiates higher priority PLMN selection based on the type of
ongoing communication.


NOTE 1: Changes needed to support the above requirement are expected
to have minimum impact on the 5G system. UE is expected to initiate the
above\-mentioned PLMN selection e.g. by locally releasing the established
N1 NAS signalling connection.



> NOTE 1a: The requirement above applies also to the case of a UE
> registered to a non\-subscribed (standalone) NPN, in order to select a
> higher priority PLMN or NPN.


The UE shall be able to delay conforming to steering of roaming
control information from the HPLMN while it is engaged in priority
service (e.g. emergency call, MPS session), or a service defined by
HPLMN policy not to be interrupted (e.g. MMTEL voice/video call).



> NOTE 2: The HPLMN policy can take into account the user's preference
> for the service(s) not to be interrupted. User preferences can be
> communicated utilizing non\-standard operator\-specific mechanisms, e.g.
> web\-based.


The mechanism mentioned above in this clause shall be available to
the HPLMN even if the VPLMN the UE is registered on is compliant to an
earlier release of the 5G system.


The 5G system shall support mechanisms to enable a credentials holder
(e.g. HPLMN or subscribed standalone NPN) to send steering of roaming
information to a UE for selecting standalone NPNs (e.g prioritized list
of preferred NPNs).


## 6\.31 Minimization of
Service Interruption


### 6\.31\.1 Description


A mobile network can fail to provide service in the event of a
disaster (for example a fire.) The requirements listed in this clause
provide the 5GS with the capability to mitigate interruption of service.
UEs can obtain service in the event of a disaster, if there are PLMN
operators prepared to offer service. The minimization of service
interruption is constrained to a particular time and place. To reduce
the impact to the 5G System and EPS of supporting Disaster Roaming, the
potential congestion resulting from an influx or outflux of Disaster
Inbound Roamers is taken into account.


Scenarios where network failures render the network subject to a
disaster unable to authenticate its subscribers are excluded.


### 6\.31\.2 Requirements


#### 6\.31\.2\.1 General


Subject to regulatory requirements or operator's policy, 3GPP system
shall be able to enable a UE of a given PLMN to obtain connectivity
service (e.g. voice call, mobile data service) from another PLMN for the
area where a Disaster Condition applies.


Subject to regulatory requirements, operator's policy or UE
capabilities, the 3GPP system shall be able to support a UE, with
5G\-only national roaming access to a VPLMN, to obtain 4G connectivity
service from that VPLMN in the area where a Disaster Condition
applies.


NOTE: In the above scenario, voice call service is provided by IMS in
HPLMN.


Subject to regulatory requirements or operator's policy, in case of
shared RAN between participating PLMNs, the 3GPP system shall be able to
support a UE of a given PLMN to obtain connectivity service (e.g. voice
call, mobile data service) from another participating network when a
Disaster Condition applies to the UE’s PLMN.


#### 6\.31\.2\.2 Disaster Condition


The 3GPP system shall enable UEs to obtain information that a
Disaster Condition applies to a particular PLMN or PLMNs.


NOTE: If a UE has no coverage of its HPLMN, then obtains information
that a Disaster Condition applies to the UE's HPLMN, the UE can register
with a PLMN offering Disaster Roaming service.


The 3GPP system shall support means for a PLMN operator to be aware
of the area where Disaster Condition applies.


The 3GPP system shall be able to support provision of service to
Disaster Inbound Roamer only within the specific region where Disaster
Condition applies.


The 3GPP system shall be able to provide efficient means for a
network to inform Disaster Inbound roamers that a Disaster Condition is
no longer applicable.


Subject to regulatory requirements or operator’s policy, the 3GPP
system shall support a PLMN operator to be made aware of the failure or
recovery of other PLMN(s) in the same country when the Disaster
Condition is applies, or when the Disaster Condition is not
applicable.


#### 6\.31\.2\.3 Disaster Roaming


The 3GPP system shall be able to provide means to enable a UE to
access PLMNs in a forbidden PLMN list if a Disaster condition applies
and no other PLMN is available except for PLMNs in the forbidden PLMN
list.


The 3GPP system shall provide means to enable that a Disaster
Condition applies to UEs of a specific PLMN.


The 3GPP system shall be able to provide a resource efficient means
for a PLMN to indicate to potential Disaster Inbound Roamers whether
they can access the PLMN or not.


Disaster Inbound Roamers shall perform network reselection when a
Disaster Condition has ended.


The 3GPP system shall minimize congestion caused by Disaster
Roaming.


The 5G system and EPS shall support a mechanism for the HPLMN to
control whether a UE, with HPLMN subscription, should apply Disaster
Roaming when a Disaster Condition arises (in the HPLMN or a VPLMN).


3GPP system shall be able to collect charging information for a
Disaster Inbound Roamer with information about the applied disaster
condition.


## 6\.32 UAV aspects


### 6\.32\.1 Description


The 3GPP system is expected to support various enhanced UAV
scenarios, especially for a wide range of applications and scenarios by
using low altitude UAVs in various commercial and government
sectors.


### 6\.32\.2 Requirements


The 3GPP system supports service requirements and KPIs related to
command and control (C2\), payload (e.g. camera) and the operation of
radio access nodes on\-board of UAVs. The associated requirements are
described in 3GPP TS 22\.125 \[26].


## 6\.33
Video, imaging and audio for professional applications


### 6\.33\.1 Description


Audio\-Visual (AV) production includes television and radio studios,
live news\-gathering, sports events, music festivals, among others.
Typically, numerous wireless devices such as microphones, in\-ear
monitoring systems or cameras are used in these scenarios. In the
future, the wireless communication service for such devices are expected
to be provided by a 5G system. AV production applications require a high
degree of confidence, since they are related to the capturing and
transmission of data at the beginning of a production chain. This
differs drastically when compared to other multimedia services because
the communication errors will be propagated to the entire audience that
is consuming that content both live and on recorded media. Furthermore,
the transmitted data is often post\-processed with filters which could
actually amplify defects that would be otherwise not noticed by humans.
Therefore, these applications call for uncompressed or slightly
compressed data, and very low probability of errors. These devices will
also be used alongside existing technologies which have a high level of
performance and so any new technologies will need to match or improve
upon the existing workflows to drive adoption of the technology.


The 3GPP system already plays an important role in the distribution
of AV media content and services. Release 14 contains substantial
enhancements to deliver TV services of various kinds, from linear TV
programmes for mass audiences to custom\-tailored on\-demand services for
mobile consumption. However, it is expected that also in the domain of
AV content and service production, 3GPP systems will become an important
tool for a market sector with steadily growing global revenues. There
are several areas in which 3GPP networks can help to produce AV content
and services in an efficient and flexible manner.


### 6\.33\.2 Requirements


The 5G system supports the communication services for video, imaging
and audio for professional applications. The associated requirements are
described in 3GPP TS 22\.263 \[28].


## 6\.34 Critical medical
applications


### 6\.34\.1 Description


The 5G system is expected to meet the service requirements for
critical medical applications where critical medical applications denote
medical devices and applications involved in the delivery of care for
patient’s survival. Additionally, as the medical industry undergoes a
shift to value\-based healthcare, where companies and healthcare
providers have to move to business models based on providing clinical
value with cost efficiency, the 5G system can help to adopt new and more
efficient care delivery models in order to reduce administrative and
supply costs.


On this matter, 5G technology can especially have an important impact
by:


\- enabling superior monitoring capability means thus improving the
effectiveness of preventive care,


\- enabling shifting care location from hospitals to homes and other
lower cost facilities,


\- improving operating room planning, enabling streamlining equipment
usage and simplifying operating theater implementation,


\- Enhancing cooperation in critical situations between ambulance and
hospital staff.


### 6\.34\.2 Requirements


The 5G system shall support the communication services for critical
medical applications. The associated requirements are described:


\- in 3GPP TS 22\.104 \[21] for the requirements related to controlling
both local or remote robotic diagnosis or surgery systems,


\- in 3GPP TS 22\.263 \[28] for the requirements related to high quality
medical imaging and augmented reality systems located in hybrid
operating rooms, in remote healthcare facilities or ambulances,


\- in 3GPP TS 22\.261 clause 7\.5 for the requirements on the support of
tele\-diagnosis or tele\-monitoring systems,


\- in 3GPP TS 22\.261 clauses 6\.10, 8\.2 and 8\.9 for the requirements on
the security of medical data that fulfil regulatory requirements.


## 6\.35 Service Function Chaining


### 6\.35\.1 Introduction


In order to support enhancement of service function chaining for 5G
networks beyond the requirements for FMSS in TS 22\.101, the network
operator defines service function chaining policies for service function
chaining to steer the traffic associated to the application and its
users on per UE basis to appropriate ordered service functions.


A service function chain for 5G networks contains service functions
such as firewall functions, NAT, antimalware, parental control, DDoS
protection, TCP proxies, load balancers, KPI monitoring, and video
optimization, etc.


NOTE: these are non\-exhaustive examples of service functions. Other
service functions can be provided by an operator.


### 6\.35\.2 General Requirements


The following requirements apply for supporting enhancement of
service function chaining for 5G networks:


\- The network operator shall be able to define and modify service
function chaining policies for steering traffic on per application per
UE basis through required service function chaining with ordered service
functions to improve the user’s QoE.


\- Service functions chaining policies shall be able to distinguish
between upstream and downstream traffic.


\- The coexistence of traffic with and without service function
chaining shall be supported.


\- Service function chaining shall provide suitable means for
authorized third parties to request a chain of service functions
provided by the network operator based on operator’s service function
chaining policies.


\- In case of roaming, the HPLMN shall be able to apply traffic
steering policies and service function chaining polices for home routed
traffic.


\- In case of roaming with local breakout, the HPLMN shall be able to
provide the traffic steering policies and service function chaining
policies to the VPLMN providing local breakout with support of service
function chaining.


\- Service function chaining shall support deployments where the
Hosted Services are provided by the operator and deployments where the
Hosted Services are provided by a third party.


### 6\.35\.3 Service Function
Management


\- The service function management shall allow the operator to create,
modify, and delete a service function based on operator’s service
function chaining policies.


\- The service function management shall allow the operator to create,
configure, and control a chain of service functions per application and
its users on per UE basis based on operator’s policy or request from
third parties.


\- The service function management shall be able to manage service
function chaining for deployments where the Hosted Services are provided
by the operator and for deployments where the Hosted Services are
provided by a third party.


## 6\.36 5G Timing Resiliency


### 6\.36\.1 Overview


5G systems rely on reference precision timing signals for network
synchronization in order to operate. These synchronization references
are generated by Primary reference Time Clocks that typically get the
timing reference from GNSS receivers and in order to meet the relevant
synchronization requirements also during failure conditions, the
synchronization network designs typically include means to address
potential degradation of the GNSS signal performance. Some deployment of
5G involve applications that themselves can be sensitive to any
degradation of the timing signal. In such cases it is beneficial for the
5G system to be enhanced to act as a backup for loss of their GNSS
references. In some implementations, timing resiliency enhancements to
the 5G system can work in collaboration with different types of time
sources (e.g., atomic clock, time service delivered over the fibre) to
provide a robust time synchronization.


5G as a consumer of time synchronization benefits from timing
resiliency which enables the support of many critical services within
the 5G network even during the event of a loss or degradation of the
primary GNSS reference timing. Additionally, for time critical services
(e.g. financial sector or smart grid), the 5G system can operate in
collaboration with or as backup to other timing solutions. A base of
clock synchronization requirements when 5G is providing a time signal,
if it is deployed in conjunction with an IEEE TSN network or if it is
providing support for IEEE 1588 related protocols, is included in \[21]
clause 5\.6\.


The enhancements in this clause build on this to add timing
resiliency to the 5G system enabling its use as a replacement or backup
for other timing sources.


### 6\.36\.2 General


The 5G system shall support enhanced timing resiliency in
collaboration with different types of time sources (e.g., GNSS, TBS/MBS
\[33] \[34], Sync over Fiber \[34]) to provide a robust time
synchronization.


The 5G system shall be able to maintain accurate time synchronization
as appropriate for the supported applications in the event of
degradation or loss of the primary timing reference (e.g., GNSS).


### 6\.36\.3 Monitoring and Reporting


The 5G system shall be able to support mechanisms to monitor for
timing source failure (e.g., GNSS).


The 5G system shall be able to detect when reference timing signals
(e.g., from GNSS or other timing source) are no longer viable for
network time synchronization.


The 5G system shall support a mechanism to determine if there is
degradation of the 5G time synchronization.


The 5G system shall be able to support mechanisms to indicate to
devices (e.g., UEs, applications) that there is an alternate time source
available for use (e.g., 5G system internal holdover capability, atomic
clock, Sync over Fiber, TBS, GNSS), taking into account the holdover
capability of the devices.


The 5G system shall be able to detect when a timing source fails or
is restored for network time synchronization.


The 5G system shall support mechanisms to monitor different time
sources and adopt the most appropriate.


The 5G system shall support a mechanism to report timing errors such
as divergence from UTC and time sync degradation to UEs and 3rd party
applications.


### 6\.36\.4 Service Exposure


The 5G system shall support a mechanism for a 3rd party application
to request resilient timing with specific KPIs (e.g., accuracy,
interval, coverage area).


## 6\.37 Ranging based services


### 6\.37\.1 Description


Ranging\-based services are the applications utilizing the distance
between two UEs and/or the direction of one UE from the other one. In 3D
case, direction includes horizontal direction and elevation direction.
Ranging\-based services can apply to a variety of verticals, such as
consumer, smart home, smart city, smart transportation, smart retail,
and industry 4\.0\. Some ranging\-based services can only require the
distance measurement, some can only require direction measurement,

## 6\.38
Personal IoT Networks and Customer Premises Networks


### 6\.38\.1 Description


Personal IoT Networks (PINs) and Customer Premises Networks (CPNs)
provide local connectivity between UEs and/or non\-3GPP devices. The CPN
via an eRG or a legacy residential gateway, or PIN Elements via a PIN
Element with Gateway Capability can provide access to 5G network
services for the UEs and/or non\-3GPP devices on the CPN or PIN. CPNs and
PINs have in common that in general they are owned, installed and/or (at
least partially) configured by a customer of a public network
operator.


A Customer Premises Network (CPN) is a network located within a
premises (e.g. a residence, office or shop). Via an evolved Residential
Gateway (eRG) or a legacy residential gateway, the CPN provides
connectivity to the 5G network. The eRG can be connected to the 5G core
network via wireline, wireless, or hybrid access: in case of wireless or
hybrid access an eRG with USIM is required; in case of wireline access
an eRG can be depoyed without a USIM. A Premises Radio Access Station
(PRAS) is a base station that can also be installed in a CPN. Through
the PRAS, UEs can get access to the CPN and/or 5G network services. The
PRAS can be configured to use licensed, unlicensed, or both frequency
bands. Connectivity between the eRG and the UE, non\-3GPP Device, or PRAS
can use any suitable non\-3GPP technology (e.g. Ethernet, optical,
WLAN).


A Personal IoT Network (PIN) consists of PIN Elements that
communicate using PIN Direct Connection or direct network connection and
is managed locally (using a PIN Element with Management Capability).
Examples of PINs include networks of wearables and smart home / smart
office equipment. Via a PIN Element with Gateway Capability, PIN
Elements have access to the 5G network services and can communicate with
PIN Elements that are not within range to use PIN Direct Connection. A
PIN includes at least one PIN Element with Gateway Capability and at
least one PIN Element with Management Capability.


A PIN Element with Management Capability is a PIN Element that
provides a means for an authorised administrator to configure and manage
a PIN.


The requirements as described in 3GPP TS 22\.101 \[6] clause 26a can
also apply to Personal IoT Networks and Customer Premises Networks.

Telephony Service


### 6\.39\.1 Description


The 5G system is expected to support advanced capabilities and
performance of enhanced IMS multimedia telephony service to meet new
demands from consumers, business customers and vertical markets.
Nowadays 3GPP has introduced new network capabilities and new types of
devices (e.g. AR/VR/XR devices, robot, etc.), which can bring promising
improvements to IMS multimedia telephony service. While more and more
individual consumers enjoy multimedia telephony services across the
globe, multimedia telephony services become popular also among business
customers. There are several primary business functions that
organizations use multimedia telephony services for, including internal
communication, talking with prospects (sales call), contacting current
customers and clients, customer support, and contact centre (or call
centre) activities. While business customers consider the multimedia
telephony services offer attractive features to their business, they
also experience some practical issues that expect support from the 5G
system.


### 6\.39\.2 General


The following set of requirements complement the requirements listed
in 3GPP TS 22\.173 \[37].


The IMS multimedia telephony service shall support AR media
processing.


### 6\.39\.3 Service Exposure


Requirements in this clause are subject to regulatory requirements
and operator policy.


The 5G system shall provide means to allow a trusted third\-party to
update the multimedia telephony service subscription and allocate a
third\-party specific identity to an authorized user.


NOTE: The third party is authorized to change user identities for
those subscriptions authorized by the operator.

\- The 5G network shall provide a means for third parties (e.g.
enterprises) to be authorized to verify the use of calling identity
information by its authorized users.


\- The 5G network shall provide a means for authorized third parties
to verify that an authenticated user is authorized to include or
reference the pre\-established calling identity information included in
the call setup or retrieved by the called party.

## 6\.40 AI/ML model transfer in
5GS


### 6\.40\.1 Description


Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) is being used in a
range of application domains across industry sectors. In mobile
communications systems, mobile devices (e.g. smartphones, automotive,
robots) are increasingly replacing conventional algorithms (e.g. speech
recognition, image recognition, video processing) with AI/ML models to
enable applications. The 5G system can at least support three types of
AI/ML operations:


\- AI/ML operation splitting between AI/ML endpoints


The AI/ML operation/model is split into multiple parts according to
the current task and environment. The intention is to offload the
computation\-intensive, energy\-intensive parts to network endpoints,
whereas leave the privacy\-sensitive and delay\-sensitive parts at the end
device. The device executes the operation/model up to a specific
part/layer and then sends the intermediate data to the network endpoint.
The network endpoint executes the remaining parts/layers and feeds the
inference results back to the device.


\- AI/ML model/data distribution and sharing over 5G system


Multi\-functional mobile terminals might need to switch the AI/ML
model in response to task and environment variations. The condition of
adaptive model selection is that the models to be selected are available
for the mobile device. However, given the fact that the AI/ML models are
becoming increasingly diverse, and with the limited storage resource in
a UE, it can be determined to not pre\-load all candidate AI/ML models
on\-board. Online model distribution (i.e. new model downloading) is
needed, in which an AI/ML model can be distributed from a NW endpoint to
the devices when they need it to adapt to the changed AI/ML tasks and
environments. For this purpose, the model performance at the UE needs to
be monitored constantly.


\- Distributed/Federated Learning over 5G system


The cloud server trains a global model by aggregating local models
partially\-trained by each end devices. Within each training iteration, a
UE performs the training based on the model downloaded from the AI
server using the local training data. Then the UE reports the interim
training results to the cloud server via 5G UL channels. The server
aggregates the interim training results from the UEs and updates the
global model. The updated global model is then distributed back to the
UEs and the UEs can perform the training for the next iteration.

information to minimize disturbance in the transfer of learning data and
AI/ML model data.

## 6\.41 Providing Access to
Local Services


### 6\.41\.1 Description


Providing access to local services refers to the capability to
provide access to a hosting network and a set of services offered by the
hosting network provider, and 3rd party service providers
including other network operators and 3rd party application providers.
The services can be localized (i.e. provided at specific/limited area)
and can be bounded in time. The user can become aware of the available
access to local services, and the process to gain and terminate access
to the hosting network and local services. This process should be
efficient, and convenient from a user experience standpoint.


Providing access to local services creates new opportunities for
users and service providers. For example, access can be provided in
areas where there is no coverage provided by other networks (for
example, on a fairground established far from other infrastructure), or
the access and local services can be established as needed (on a
short\-term basis), without the need for long term business
relationships, permanently installed equipment, etc.


The type of local services and access for localized services via a
hosting network can be promoted and arranged through different channels.
Principally the service providers (e.g., brick and mortar businesses,
entertainment venues, construction contractors, first responder
agencies, etc.) will provide information and proper incentive or
instructions to potential users so that they will seek to access the
local services via hosting networks.


### 6\.41\.2 Requirements


#### 6\.41\.2\.1 General


In the requirements below, it is assumed that:


\- Both the home network and the hosting network can be a PLMN or
NPN.


\- Only subscribers of a public network can roam into a PLMN. Examples
of interworking scenarios between network operators and application
providers for localized services are indicated in Annex H.


#### 6\.41\.2\.2
Configuration of Localized Services in Hosting Network


NOTE: The term “Service provider of localized services” includes also
3rd party service provider.


The 5G system shall support suitable mechanisms to allow
automatically establishing localized service agreements for a specific
occasion (time and location) and building temporary relationship among
hosting network operator and other service providers including network
operators or 3rd party application providers.


The 5G system shall support means for the service provider to request
the hosting network via standard mechanisms to provide access to
3rd party services at a specific period of time and location.
This period of time shall be flexible, so that a change in service
provision can be decided at any time (e.g., to cancel or prolong local
services in the locality of service delivery) based on localized
services agreements.


Based on localized services agreements, the 5G system shall provide
suitable means to allow the service provider to request and provision
various localized service requirements, including QoS, expected/maximum
number of users, event information for discovery, network slicing,

The 5G system shall support means for a hosting network to notify the
service provider of the accepted service parameters and routing
policies.


Subject to regulatory requirements and localized service agreements,
the 5G system shall allow a home network operator to automatically
negotiate policies with the hosting network for allowing the home
network’s subscribers to connect at a specific occasion, e.g., time and
location, for their home network services.


Subject to the automatic localized services agreements between the
hosting network operator and home network operator, for UE with only
home network subscription and with authorization to access hosting
networks the 5G system shall support:


\- access to the hosting network and use home network services or
selected localized services via the hosting network,


\- seamless service continuity for home network services or selected
localized services when moving between two hosting networks or a host
network and the home network.


The 5G system shall support a mechanism to enable configuration of a
network that provides access to localized services such that the
services can be limited in terms of their spatial extent (in terms of a
particular topology, for example a single cell), as specified by a
service provider of localized services.


The 5G system shall support a mechanism to enable configuration of a
network that provides access to localized services such that the
services can be limited in terms of the resources or capacity available,
to correspond to requirements that apply only to the locality of service
delivery, as specified by a service provider of localized services.


The 5G system shall support means for a hosting network to provide a
3rd party service provider with information for automatic
discovery of the hosting network by the UEs to allow access to specific
3rd party services.


The 5G system shall support secure mechanisms to allow a home network
to coordinate with a hosting network for a subscriber to temporarily

User Manual Selection of Localized Services via Hosting Network


The hosting network shall allow a UE to manually select temporary
localized services which are provided via local breakout at the hosting

as time and location) via the hosting network or the UE’s home
network.


The 5G system shall enable a UE to use credentials provided by the
hosting network with or without coordination with the home network of
the UE, to make use of localized services via the hosting network with a
certain time (including starting time and the duration) and location
validity.

authenticate and authorize a user of a UE accessing a hosting
network~~,~~ including cases in which a UE has no subscription to
the hosting network and still needs to get authorized to use localized
services via the hosting network.


NOTE: It can be assumed that a network provider deploying a hosting
network has access to respective identification information about the
user, e.g., through a separate registration process outside the scope of
3GPP.


The 5G system shall be able to authenticate and authorize the UE of a
user authenticated to a hosting network to access the hosting network
and its localized services on request of a service provider.


#### 6\.41\.2\.5 UE Discovery,

Subject to operator’s policy and agreement between a 3rd
party service provider and operator, the 5G system shall enable a UE to
receive and use configuration provided by a 3rd party service
provider to discover and access a hosting network and localized
services, including the considerations of prior service agreement with a
3rd party service provider and no prior subscription to
hosting network. If the UE is able to obtain services from two networks
simultaneously, it may additionally select the hosting network. If the
UE cannot maintain the connection to the home network while selecting
the hosting network, the selection shall only be done on request by the
user, i.e., using manual selection.


The 5G system shall support secure means for a UE to select and
access localized services which may be provided by a 3rd
party service provider via a hosting network, independent of prior
subscription to the hosting network or 3rd party service
provider.


The 5G system shall enable the home network to allow a UE to
automatically select a hosting network for accessing localized services
when specified conditions (e.g., predefined time, location) are
fulfilled.


The 5G system shall be able to prevent a UE to re\-access the hosting
network after the localized services were terminated if the
authorization for the localized services is no longer valid (e.g., can
be based on certain conditions such as time or location of the
user).

prior subscription to the hosting network to display human readable
information on how to gain access to the hosting network and available
3rd party services.

select a specific local hosting network.


NOTE: Additional information can be presented to the user to
facilitate the manual network selection.


The 5G system shall be able to limit access of specific UEs to a
configurable area of a hosting network's coverage area.


The 5G system shall be able to maintain privacy of a user against the
hosting network while the UE does not make use of the hosting network,
for example, to prevent tracking of UEs by hosting networks.


The 5G system shall enable the home network to instruct a UE to
select a hosting network with certain conditions (e.g., predefined time,
location) based on the request from a service provider.


The 5G system shall enable the home network to allow a UE to select a
hosting network or change to another hosting network, without any
additional user intervention as long as the delivered services, both
localized services and home routed services, are unchanged.


#### 6\.41\.2\.6
Hosting Network Localized Services and Home Operator Services


The 5G system shall enable the home network operator to indicate to
the UE what services are preferred to be used from the home network when
the UE connects to a hosting network and the requested services are
available from both the hosting and the home network.


Based on localized service agreements, the hosting network shall be
able to provide required connectivity and QoS for a UE simultaneously
connected to the hosting network for localized services and its home
network for home network services.


A UE shall be able to connect to its home network via the hosting
network, if supported by the hosting network and the home network based
on localized service agreements.

control plane overload caused by a high number of UEs returning from a
temporary local access of a hosting network to their home network in a
very short period of time.


The 5G system shall provide mechanisms to minimize the impact on the
UEs communication e.g., to prevent user plane and control plane outages
when returning to a home network together with other high number of UEs
in a very short period of time, after terminating their temporary local
access to a hosting network.


#### 6\.41\.2\.8 Charging


The 5G system shall be able to collect charging information for the
use of localized services at the hosting network and provide the
charging records to UEs’ home operators based on localized service
agreements and charging policies provided by the service providers of
localized services.


#### 6\.41\.2\.9 Regulatory Services


A hosting network using the 5G system shall be able to support
regulatory services (e.g., PWS, LI, and emergency calls), based on
regional/national regulatory requirements.


#### 6\.41\.2\.10 Multicast/Broadcast


The operator of a hosting network shall support a mechanism allowing
different service providers of localized services to disseminate their
services and content over broadcast/multicast transport. This mechanism
should also provide means to include diverse content in the same
transmission, e.g., to include advertisements with other content, or to
include multiple content in the same media delivered to the user.


A hosting network shall provide multicast and broadcast services in
an energy efficient manner to UEs receiving this service.


A hosting network shall support resource efficient content delivery
through multicast/broadcast.


A hosting network shall support a mechanism to provide low latency
signalling for efficient content delivery to many UEs.


Subject to home operator policy, a hosting network shall be able to
prioritize specific multicast and broadcast services for local access
over home routed access, even if the same service is available in both
networks.


## 6\.42 Mobile base station relays


### 6\.42\.1 Description


The requirements below refer to a “*mobile base station
relay”*, which is a mobile base station acting as a relay between a
UE and the 5G network, i.e. providing a NR access link to UEs and
connected wirelessly (using NR) through a donor NG\-RAN to the 5G Core.
Such mobile base station relay is assumed to be mounted on a moving
vehicle and serve UEs that can be located inside or outside the vehicle
(or entering/leaving the vehicle).


NOTE: The radio link used between a mobile base station relay and
served UEs, as well as between mobile base station relay and donor RAN,
is assumed to be NR\-Uu; in that regard, it should be clear that a mobile
base station relay is different than a UE relay (which uses instead a
PC5\-based link to provide indirect connection to remote UEs).


Few main underlying assumptions are:


\- requirements cover single\-hop relay scenarios as baseline
(multi\-hop is not precluded);


\- legacy UEs are supported;


\- other stage\-1 requirements (e.g. on wireless self\-backhaul), as
well as existing stage\-2/3 functionalities and architecture options
(e.g. IAB) do not assume or address full relay mobility (e.g. relays on
board of moving vehicles), thus cannot cover the requirements below,
which are intended to be specific to mobile base station relays;



> \- the identified requirements do not intend to imply or exclude
> specific network/relay architectures and topology solutions (e.g. could
> be IAB based, or others);


\- the MNO managing mobile base station relays, and the RAN/5GC they
connect to, can be a PLMN or an NPN operator.


### 6\.42\.2 Requirements


The 5G system shall support efficient operation of mobile base
station relays.


The 5G system shall be able to support means, for a mobile network

mechanisms to control UEs’ selection and access to a mobile base station
relay, e.g. based on UE’s authorization, geographic or temporary
restrictions, relay’s load.


The 5G system shall be able to support RAN sharing between multiple
PLMNs for UEs connected to the 5G network via mobile base station
relays.


NOTE 1: the above requirement assumes both relay and (donor) RAN
resources, including UE access link and relay backhaul link, are shared
among operators.


The 5G system shall be able to configure and provision specific
required QoS for traffic relayed via a mobile base station relay.


NOTE 2: QoS is end\-to\-end, i.e. from UE to 5GC.

5G system shall support means to configure and expose monitoring
information of a mobile base station relay to an MNO’s authorized
third\-party.


The 5G system shall be able to provide means to optimize network
behaviour to efficiently deliver data based on the mobility information
(e.g., itinerary), known or predicted, of mobile base station
relays.


The 5G system shall be able to support communication from/to users of
one MNO (MNO\-A) via mobile base station relays, where the traffic
between the relay and the MNO\-A network is transported using 5G
connectivity (RAN and 5GC) provided by a different MNO (MNO\-B).


NOTE 3: The 5G connectivity provided to the MNO\-A relays by the
different MNO (MNO\-B) assumes a generic wireless backhaul transport,
independent from the mobile base station relay functionalities.


The 5G system shall be able to support UEs connectivity to RAN using
simultaneously, a link without mobile base station relay and a link via
a mobile base station relay, or simultaneous links via different mobile
base station relays.


NOTE 4: The above requirements cover scenarios were the two links (to
the RAN) could be connected to the same or different RAN node(s), and
assuming both relay(s) and RAN belong to the same PLMN.


The 5G system shall be able to provide means to support efficient UE
cell selection and cell reselection (between mobile base station relays
or between relays and RAN) in the presence of mobile base station
relays.


The 5G system shall be able to ensure end\-to\-end service continuity,
in the presence of mobile base station relays.


NOTE 5: The above requirement intends to cover different scenarios of
UE mobility (e.g. UE moving between two mobile base station relays, or
between macro RAN and relay) and relay mobility (e.g. base station relay
moving between different donor RAN nodes).


The 5G system shall be able to support mechanisms to optimize
mobility and energy efficiency for UEs located in a vehicle equipped
with a base station relay.


NOTE 6: The above requirements cover scenarios where mobile base
station relays provide 5G access for both UEs in the vehicle and around
the vehicle.


The 5G system shall be able to support incremental deployment of
connectivity by means of one or a series of mobile base station relays
for use only in specific locations where UEs would receive no other 3GPP
access (terrestrial or non\-terrestrial) coverage, e.g., for public
safety scenarios.


The 5G system shall be able to support mobile base station relays
using 3GPP satellite NG\-RAN (NR satellite access).


The 5G system shall be able to support mobile base station relays
accessing to 5GC via NR satellite access and NR terrestrial access
simultaneously.


The 5G system shall be able to support service continuity for mobile
base station relays using at least one 3GPP satellite NG\-RAN.


NOTE 7: This requirement applies to scenarios where there is a
transition between two 3GPP NG\-RAN, operated by the same MNO, involving
at least one 3GPP satellite NG\-RAN.


The 5G system shall be able to identify and differentiate UEs’
traffic carried via a mobile base station relay and collect charging
information, including specific relay information (e.g. geographic
location served by the relay).


The 5G system shall support means for a mobile base station relay to
have a certain subscription with a HPLMN, used to get access and
connectivity to the HPLMN network (via a donor RAN).


The 5G system shall support the ability of a base station relay to
roam from its HPLMN into a VPLMN.


The 5G system shall support mechanisms, for the HPLMN controlling a
mobile base station relay, to enable/disable mobile relay operation if
the relay is roaming in a VPLMN.


The 5G system shall support mechanisms to disable mobile relay
operation by a VPLMN where a mobile base station relay is roaming
to.


The 5G system shall be able to fulfil necessary regulatory
requirements (e.g. for support of emergency services) when UEs access
the 3GPP network via a mobile base station relay.


The 5G system shall be able to support priority services (e.g. MPS)
when UEs access the 3GPP network via a mobile base station relay.


The 5G system shall be able to support location services for the UEs
accessing 5GS via a mobile base station relay.


The 5G system shall ensure that existing end\-to\-end 5G security
between the UE and 3GPP network is unaffected when the UE accesses the
3GPP network via a mobile base station relay.


The 5G system shall be able to minimize radio interference possibly
caused by mobile base station relays.


The 5G system shall minimize the impact of the presence of mobile
base station relays on radio network management (e.g. through automatic
neighbour cell list configuration).


## 6\.43 Tactile and
multi\-modal communication service


### 6\.43\.1 Description


The tactile and multi\-modal communication service can be applied in
multiple fields, e.g. industry, robotics and telepresence, virtual
reality, augmented reality, healthcare, road traffic, serious gaming,
education, culture and smart grid \[38]. These services support
applications enabling input from more than one sources and/or output to
more than one destinations to convey information more effectively. As
figure 6\.43\.1\-1 illustrates, the input and output can be different
modalities including:


* Video/Audio media;
* Information received by sensors about the environment, e.g.
brightness, temperature, humidity, etc.;
* Haptic data: can be feelings when touching a surface (e.g.,
pressure, texture, vibration, temperature), or kinaesthetic senses (e.g.
gravity, pull forces, sense of position awareness).


![](media/image4.png)


**Figure 6\.43\.1\-1\. Multi\-modal interactive system**


For immersive multi\-modal VR applications, synchronization between
different media components is critical in order to avoid having a
negative impact on the user experience (i.e. viewers detecting lack of
synchronization), particularly when the synchronization threshold
between two or more modalities is less than the latency KPI for the
application. Example synchronization thresholds \[41] \[42] \[43] \[44] are
summarised in table 6\.43\.1\-1\.


**Table 6\.43\.1\-1: Typical** **synchronization
thresholds for immersive multi\-modality VR applications**








| **Media components** | **synchronization threshold (note 1\)** | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **audio\-tactile** | audio delay: 50 ms | tactile delay: 25 ms |
| **visual\-tactile** | visual delay: 15 ms | tactile delay: 50 ms |
| NOTE 1: for each media component, “delay” refers to the case where that media component is delayed compared to the other. | | |


### 6\.43\.2 Requirements


The 5G system shall enable an authorized 3rd party to provide
policy(ies) for flows associated with an application. The policy may
contain e.g. the set of UEs and data flows, the expected QoS handling
and associated triggering events, other coordination information.


The 5G system shall support a means to apply 3rd party provided
policy(ies) for flows associated with an application. The policy may
contain e.g. the set of UEs and data flows, the expected QoS handling
and associated triggering events, other coordination information.



> NOTE: The policy can be used by a 3rd party application for
> coordination of the transmission of multiple UEs’ flows (e.g., haptic,
> audio and video) of a multi\-modal communication session.


## 6\.44 Roaming value\-added
services


### 6\.44\.1 Description


#### 6\.44\.1\.1 Overview


Roaming value\-added services (RVAS) form part of the roaming services
ecosystem and have traditionally been provided by either the PLMN or
outsourced to a fully trusted entity. The RVAS provider acting on behalf
of the PLMN could be any trusted 3rd party. The RVAS described here are
all RVAS enabled by the PLMN for 5GS roaming.


#### 6\.44\.1\.2 Welcome SMS


The “Welcome SMS” service sends a SMS to a roaming subscriber’s UE
when the UE is registered in a new network for the first time. The SMS
typically follows a predefined template and is sent on behalf of the
home operator and may contain relevant information related to the
visited country, e.g., the cost to call home, how to reach the
operator’s customer service, local emergency services number, etc.


#### 6\.44\.1\.3
Steering of Roaming (SoR) during the registration


The “Steering of Roaming (SoR) during the registration procedure”
service makes the home operator able to steer a user to a certain
network during the registration procedure when the user tries to
register to a new (non\-preferred) network.


NOTE: This functionality is different from Steering of Roaming
described in clause 6\.30, which aims to influence which network a UE
would try to register on.


#### 6\.44\.1\.4
Subscription\-based routing to a particular core network (e.g. in a
different country)


The “Subscription\-based routing to a particular core network” service
forwards the traffic from the HPLMN to a target PLMN. Some operators use
more than one PLMN ID, e.g., multi\-national operators. Due to certain
business and operational demands, it might be necessary to route traffic
of a certain customer segment, typically from a certain IMSI range of
USIMs, of a PLMN to another PLMN and to further handle the subscriber
there. This means the UE is not handled by the "real" HPLMN (according
to MNC and MCC) but by some alternative PLMN.


This subscription\-based routing enables the case where several
national subsidiaries of a multi\-national operator offer various
services for different customer segments but for operational efficiency
the actual service for a certain group is provided by only one dedicated
network.


### 6\.44\.2 Requirements


#### 6\.44\.2\.1 Welcome SMS


The 5G system shall be able to support mechanisms for the HPLMN to
provide a notification, including equipment and subscription
identifiers, to a trusted application server when a UE successfully
registers in a VPLMN. In response to the notification, the trusted
application server can indicate specific actions to the HPLMN (e.g.,
send an SMS to the UE).


NOTE: The trusted application server can be hosted by the home
operator or a trusted 3rd party and is out of 3GPP scope.


6\.44\.2\.2 Steering of Roaming (SoR) during the registration
procedure


The 5G system shall be able to support mechanisms enabling the HPLMN
to:


\- provide a notification, including subscription and equipment
identifiers, to a trusted application server when a UE tries to register
in a VPLMN.


\- receive a notification reply from the trusted application server
indicating specific actions to the HPLMN, e.g., reject UE registration
(with a specific cause), trigger a SoR command.


NOTE: The trusted application server can be hosted by the home
operator or a trusted 3rd party and is out of 3GPP scope.


#### 6\.44\.2\.3
Subscription\-based routing to a particular core network (e.g. in a
different country)


The 5G system shall be able to support a mechanism such that all
traffic pertaining to UEs of specific subscribers which is sent to the
HPLMN is forwarded to a target PLMN, e.g., to enable further handling of
those UEs by the target PLMN. The forwarding mechanism shall minimize
traffic in the HPLMN, e.g., by using efficient means to forward traffic
from selected UEs.


NOTE 1: The above requirement assumes that the HPLMN has an agreement
with the target PLMN, and routing policies are in place.


NOTE 2: In case of UEs connected via a VPLMN, it is assumed that
traffic is forwarded to the target PLMN by the HPLMN.


## 6\.45 Support of Roaming
services providers


### 6\.45\.1 Overview


In the roaming ecosystem, a roaming services provider provides the
technical and commercial means to facilitate the deployment and
operation of roaming services between a client operator and a set of
selected connected operators.


The roaming services provider handles the technical implementation of
the roaming relations in a scalable and operationally efficient way.


With a roaming services provider present in the roaming ecosystem,
operators can choose not to establish a bilateral direct agreement with
specific operators. A trusted relation exists between the involved
operator and the roaming services provider.


Roaming services providers, according to their role and
responsibilities, assume financial and technical liability to apply all
necessary controls and access to all communications.


Among other functionalities, a roaming services provider needs
to:


• Process identifiers and potentially other information transmitted
in signalling messages between PLMNs in a secure manner.


• Be able to modify, add or delete information that is relevant to
their role, respecting what is contractually agreed in service level
agreements (SLAs) and enforced technically.


• Isolate the individual operator signalling flows from each
other


• Report on the detection of and mitigation of security breaches.


### 6\.45\.2 Requirements


The 5G system shall allow roaming services to be provided by a
roaming services provider in charge of managing roaming agreements, by
mediating between two or more PLMNs, while maintaining the privacy and
5G security of any information transmitted between the home and the
serving PLMN.


NOTE 1: A PLMN can support both bi\-lateral direct relationships with
other PLMNs and make use of roaming service provider services toward
different roaming partners.


The 5G system shall allow a roaming services provider to be a trusted
entity for either a home PLMN, a visited PLMN or both.


NOTE 2: The expected maximum number of roaming service providers is
two, one for the home PLMN and another for the visited PLMN.


The 5G system shall allow a roaming services provider to accept or
reject registration attempts, on behalf of the involved PLMNs, based on
the roaming agreements.


NOTE 3: Rejecting user registrations using an appropriate release
cause permits the UE to be able to reselect another roaming partner or
technology.


The 5G system shall allow a roaming services provider to identify the
origin and destination PLMN, and to verify the authenticity, of every
transmitted message.


The 5G system shall allow the Roaming services provider to be able to
originate and modify messages as per contractually agreed SLAs.


The 5G system shall allow the involved PLMNs to be able to identify
the origin of any message generated by the roaming services providers as
well as to identify any modification made to the exchanged messages by
the roaming services providers.

(using satellite access) and vice\-versa.


NOTE: It is assumed that the 5G terrestrial access network and the
satellite access network belong to the same operator.


* Subject to regulatory requirements and operator’s policy, a 5G
system with satellite access shall be able to support service continuity
(with minimum service interruption) of a UE\-Satellite\-UE communication

between different 5G networks of a relay UE and the remote UEs connected
to that relay UE.


### 6\.46\.8 Store and Forward
Satellite Operation


#### 6\.46\.8\.1 Description


NGSO (MEO/LEO) based satellite access is raising higher demands on
the amount of ground stations, and the availability and stability of the
connectivity to ground station for UEs to obtain end\-to\-end network
services anytime.


S\&F (Store and Forward) Satellite operation in some level
provides a way to enable autonomously network service to UEs without the
satellite always being connected to the ground station, which can extend
the service availability for the areas without the connectivity to
ground station via feeder link or ISL (e.g. at sea, very remote areas
lack of ground\-station infrastructures), improve the ground segment
affordability with fewer ground stations and allow more robust UE
services with the satellite under intermittently/temporarily unavailable
feeder link.


This is particularly relevant for delay\-tolerant communications via
NGSO space segment.


The requirements below refer to S\&F (Store and Forward) Satellite
operation.


NOTE: For more information on Store and Forward Satellite operation
see Annex J.


#### 6\.46\.8\.2 Requirements


Subject to operator’s policies, a 5G system with satellite access

e.g. store data on the satellite when the feeder link is unavailable;
and forward the data once the feeder link between the satellite and the
ground segment becomes available.

supporting S\&F Satellite operation shall be able to support
forwarding of the stored data from one satellite to another satellite
(e.g., which has an available feeder link to the ground network),
through ISLs.


NOTE: It is assumed that the satellite constellation knows which
satellite has a feeder link available. However, this is outside the

## 6\.49 Mobile Metaverse Services


### 6\.49\.1 Description


Mobile metaverse services refer to a shared, perceived set of
interactive perceived spaces that can be persistent. The term metaverse
has been used in various ways to refer to the broader implications of AR
and VR. Metaverse in diverse sectors evokes a number of possible user
experiences, products and services can emerge once virtual reality and
augmented reality become commonly available and find application in our
work, leisure and other activities. Functional enhancements and
capabilities included in standards specifications make these services
function well, consistently and with diverse support mechanisms over
mobile telecommunications networks.


In addition to services that offer virtual or location\-independent
user experiences, mobile metaverse services also supports content and
services that are associated or applicable only in a particular
location. These metaverse services are mobile in the sense that mobile
users are able to interact with services anywhere and in particular when
in the locations where specific services are offered. Requirements for
diverse service enablers are introduced to the 5G system to support
these services, including avatar call functionality, coordination of
services, digital asset management and support for spatial anchors.


### 6\.49\.2 Requirements


The 5G system supports services and service enablers for Mobile
Metaverse Services. The associated functional and performance

communication service.


## 6\.50
Traffic steering and switching over two 3GPP access networks


### 6\.50\.1 Introduction


The following requirements cover scenarios and functionalities for
supporting enhanced traffic steering and switching of a DualSteer
device’s user data (for different services) across two 3GPP access
networks, assuming the ability to differentiate the two connections for
the same device and minimize impacts to CN, O\&M or IT systems.


Target scenarios cover two 3GPP access networks belonging to the same
PLMN, or between two different PLMNs, or between one PLMN and one
PLMN\-integrated NPN, over same or different RAT, which can use
terrestrial and/or satellite access (including the case of two different
satellite orbits). Scenarios may also include traffic steering and/or
switching across E\-UTRA/EPC and NR/5GC, with anchoring in 5GC.


Traffic policies are intended to be in full control of the home
network operator.


The requirements below can apply to different DualSteer device types
(e.g., smartphones, IoT, UAV, VSAT devices).


### 6\.50\.2 Requirements


For the requirements below, the following applies:


\- a subscriber with two subscriptions/SUPIs, sharing one subscription
profile from the same operator;  

\- for simultaneous transmission over two networks, a DualSteer device is
assumed to include two separate UEs.


#### 6\.50\.2\.1 General


Subject to HPLMN policy and network control, the 5G system shall be
able to support mechanisms to enable traffic steering and/or switching
of a DualSteer device’s user data (for different services) across two
3GPP access networks belonging to the same PLMN (either HPLMN or VPLMN),
assuming data anchoring in the HPLMN and non\-simultaneous transmission
over the two networks.


Subject to HPLMN policy and network control, the 5G system may be
able to support mechanisms to enable traffic steering and/or switching
with simultaneous transmission of a DualSteer device’s user data (for
different services) across two 3GPP access networks belonging to the
same PLMN (either HPLMN or VPLMN), assuming data anchoring in the
HPLMN.


Subject to HPLMN policy and network control, the 5G system shall be
able to support mechanisms to enable traffic steering and/or switching
of a DualSteer device’s user data (for different services) across two
3GPP access networks belonging to two PLMNs, assuming a business/roaming
agreement between PLMN operators (if different), data anchoring in the
HPLMN and non\-simultaneous transmission over the two networks.


Subject to HPLMN policy and network control, the 5G system may be
able to support mechanisms to enable traffic steering and/or switching
with simultaneous transmission of a DualSteer device’s user data (for
different services) across two 3GPP access networks belonging to two
PLMNs, assuming a business/roaming agreement between PLMN operators (if
different) and HPLMN data anchoring.


NOTE 1: Inter\-PLMN requirements can apply also to PLMN\-NPN scenarios
assuming a PLMN\-integrated NPN (NPN hosted by a PLMN or offered as a
slice of a PLMN).


For traffic steering and/or switching of user data across two 3GPP
access networks, the 5G system shall be able to allow a HPLMN to provide
policies and criteria for a DualSteer device to connect to an additional
PLMN/NPN, or an additional RAT within the same PLMN.


NOTE 2: The above requirements assume configuration of traffic
policies, under HPLMN control or negotiated between the HPLMN and other
network operators, considering e.g., user subscription,
application/traffic type, service preference, QoS requirements,
location, time, UE capabilities, mobility, connectivity conditions.


For any particular service, at any given time, the DualSteer device
shall transmit all traffic of that service using only a single 3GPP
access network.


#### 6\.50\.2\.2 Mobility and
connectivity changes


Subject to HPLMN policy and network control, the 5G system shall be
able to support mechanisms to minimize service interruption when
switching a DualSteer device’s user data, for one or multiple services,
between two 3GPP access networks.


Subject to HPLMN policy and network control, for traffic steering
and/or switching of user data across two 3GPP access networks, the 5G
system may be able to support mechanisms to change one 3GPP access
network to the non\-3GPP access network of the same subscription (and
vice versa).


#### 6\.50\.2\.3 Other aspects


Subject to HPLMN policy and network control, the 5G system shall be
able to collect charging information related to traffic steering and/or
switching of a DualSteer device’s user data across two 3GPP access
networks.


NOTE 1: Charging information should be collected for both 3GPP access
networks; in case the two 3GPP access networks belong to different
PLMNs, or a PLMN and NPN, a proper business/roaming agreement among
network operators is assumed.


Subject to home network operator policy and network control, the 5G
system shall be able to support traffic steering and/or switching of a
DualSteer device’s user data between a NPN and a PLMN, for one or more a
DualSteer devices with a NPN subscription accessing NPN services, to
meet specific QoS requirements for each device, assuming
non\-simultaneous transmission over the two 3GPP access networks.


NOTE 2: The above assumes a NPN hosted by a PLMN or offered as a
slice of a PLMN, data anchoring in the NPN, and a business/roaming
agreement between the PLMN and the NPN operator (if different).


## 6\.51
Monitoring of network elements interactions in 5G


### 6\.51\.1 Overview


External monitoring systems are often used by MNOs to track network
activity for network surveillance and troubleshooting to perform
diagnosis and fault analysis of their system. Such monitoring system is
fully under the control of the MNOs, and the monitoring can be performed
at signalling level. Due to the introduction of encryption of the
signalling exchanged between network functions, there is no
standardized, secure interface to share signalling traffic between the
5G network and the monitoring system.


A number of capabilities are required for the 5G network to continue
supporting this feature, with regards to performance to minimise the
impact on the real\-time traffic and to consider the security needed to
protect the copies sent towards the external monitoring system.


### 6\.51\.2 Requirements


NOTE 1: The monitoring system is outside of the 5G network. Both the
monitoring system and the monitored network elements in the requirements
below are fully under the control of the MNO.


The monitored network elements in the 5G network shall support the
transmission of a secured copy of the outgoing and incoming signalling
traffic to a monitoring system.


The 5G network shall enable the MNO to configure network monitoring,
e.g., switching on/off per network element, selecting what type of
elements and what type of signalling from these elements is the target
for monitoring.


The 5G network shall allow the monitoring (i.e., transmit secured
copies of outgoing and incoming signalling traffic) of a transmitting
network element and, separately, the monitoring of the receiving network
element while facilitating correlation of the information received from
both network elements by the external system.


NOTE 2: These requirements do not imply/assume any design of the
network elements. How the copies are created within the element, e.g.,
physical, virtual or container based, is expected to be implementation
specific.


The signalling traffic shall be securely transmitted from the
monitored network elements of the 5G network to the monitoring system
while minimizing the degradation of network performance.


NOTE 3: The monitoring system is not integrated with the key
management scheme of the 5G core.


The transmission of signalling traffic from the monitored network
elements of the 5G network to the monitoring system shall be compliant
with privacy legislation, data protection regulations and protection of
confidential system internal data.


The transmission of signalling traffic from the monitored network
elements of the 5G network to the monitoring system shall be limited
regarding the number of file formats (e.g., JSON, PCAP, etc.) to assist
with the ingestion of traffic feeds.


# 7 Performance requirements


## 7\.1 High data rates and
traffic densities


Several scenarios require the support of very high data rates or
traffic densities of the 5G system. The scenarios address different
service areas: urban and rural areas, office and home, and special
deployments (e.g. massive gatherings, broadcast, residential, and
high\-speed vehicles). The scenarios and their performance requirements
can be found in table 7\.1\-1\.


\- Urban macro – The general wide\-area scenario in urban area


\- Rural macro – The general wide\-area scenario in rural area


\- Indoor hotspot – The scenario for offices and homes, and
residential deployments.


\- Broadband access in a crowd – The scenario for very dense crowds,
for example, at stadiums or concerts. In addition to a very high
connection density the users want to share what they see and hear,
putting a higher requirement on the uplink than the downlink.


\- Dense urban – The scenario for pedestrian users, and users in urban
vehicles, for example, in offices, city centres, shopping centres, and
residential areas. The users in vehicles can be connected either
directly or via an onboard base station to the network.


\- Broadcast\-like services – The scenario for stationary users,
pedestrian users, and users in vehicles, for example, in offices, city
centres, shopping centres, residential areas, rural areas and in high
speed trains. The passengers in vehicles can be connected either
directly or via an onboard base station to the network.


\- High\-speed train – The scenario for users in trains. The users can
be connected either directly or via an onboard base station to the
network.


\- High\-speed vehicle – The scenario for users in road vehicles. The
users can be connected either directly or via an onboard base station to
the network.


\- Airplanes connectivity – The scenario for users in airplanes. The
users can be connected either directly or via an onboard base station to
the network.

density scenarios.

| NOTE 1: For users in vehicles, the UE can be connected to the network directly, or via an on\-board moving base station. NOTE 2: A certain traffic mix is assumed; only some users use services that require the highest data rates \[2]. NOTE 3: For interactive audio and video services, for example, virtual meetings, the required two\-way end\-to\-end latency (UL and DL) is 2‑4 ms while the corresponding experienced data rate needs to be up to 8K 3D video \[300 Mbit/s] in uplink and downlink. NOTE 4: These values are derived based on overall user density. Detailed information can be found in \[10]. NOTE 5: All the values in this table are targeted values and not strict requirements. | | | | | | | | | |


## 7\.2 Low latency and high
reliability


### 7\.2\.1 Overview


Several scenarios require the support of very low latency and very
high communications service availability. Note that this implies a very
high reliability. The overall service latency depends on the delay on
the radio interface, transmission within the 5G system, transmission to
a server which can be outside the 5G system, and data processing. Some
of these factors depend directly on the 5G system itself, whereas for
others the impact can be reduced by suitable interconnections between
the 5G system and services or servers outside of the 5G system, for
example, to allow local hosting of the services.


### 7\.2\.2 Scenarios and KPIs


Different deployments of URLLC capabilities will depend on the 3GPP
system being able to meet specific sets of KPIs with different values
and ranges applicable for each attribute. A common, yet flexible, 5G
approach to URLLC will enable the 5G system to meet the specific sets of
KPIs needed in a given implementation. To provide clear and precise
requirements for specific types of services, the corresponding KPI
requirements are included in other specifications as follows:



> \- Cyber\-physical control applications in vertical domains can be
> found in 22\.104 \[21].
> 
> 
> \- V2X can be found in 22\.186 \[9].
> 
> 
> \- Rail communications can be found in 22\.289 \[23].


Some scenarios requiring very low latency and very high communication
service availability are described below:


\- Motion control – Conventional motion control is characterised by
high requirements on the communications system regarding latency,
reliability, and availability. Systems supporting motion control are
usually deployed in geographically limited areas but can also be
deployed in wider areas (e.g. city\- or country\-wide networks), access to
them can be limited to authorized users, and they can be isolated from
networks or network resources used by other cellular customers.


\- Discrete automation – Discrete automation is characterised by high
requirements on the communications system regarding reliability and
availability. Systems supporting discrete automation are usually
deployed in geographically limited areas, access to them can be limited
to authorized users, and they can be isolated from networks or network
resources used by other cellular customers.


\- Process automation – Automation for (reactive) flows, e.g.
refineries and water distribution networks. Process automation is
characterized by high requirements on the communications system
regarding communication service availability. Systems supporting process
automation are usually deployed in geographically limited areas, access
to them is usually limited to authorized users, and it will usually be
served by non\-public networks.


\- Automation for electricity distribution and smart grid (mainly
medium and high voltage). Electricity distribution and smart grid are is
characterized by high requirements on the communications service
availability and security, as well as low latency in some cases. In
contrast to the above use cases, electricity distribution and smart grid
are deeply immersed into the public space. Since electricity
distribution is an essential infrastructure, it is well served by
network slices to provide service isolation and security, or by
non\-public networks.


\- Wireless road\-side infrastructure backhaul in intelligent transport
systems – Automation solutions for the infrastructure supporting
street\-based traffic. This use case addresses the connection of the
road\-side infrastructure, e.g. roadside units, with other
infrastructure, e.g. a traffic guidance system. As is the case for
automation electricity, the nodes are deeply immersed into the public
space.


\- Remote control – Remote control is characterised by a UE being
operated remotely by a human or a computer. For example, Remote Driving
enables a remote driver or a V2X application to operate a remote vehicle
with no driver or a remote vehicle located in a dangerous
environment.


\- Rail communications (e.g. railway, rail\-bound mass transit) have
been using 3GPP based mobile communication (e.g. GSM\-R) already for some
time, while there is still a driver on\-board of the train. The next step
of the evolution will be providing fully automated train operation that
requires highly reliable communication with moderate latencies but at
very high speeds of up to 500 km/h.


For specific requirements, refer to the specifications noted above
\[21], \[9], \[23].


### 7\.2\.3 Other requirements


#### 7\.2\.3\.1 (void)


#### 7\.2\.3\.2 Wireless
road\-side infrastructure backhaul


Intelligent Transport Systems embrace a wide variety of
communications\-related applications that are intended to increase travel
safety, minimize environmental impact, improve traffic management, and
maximize the benefits of transportation to both commercial users and the
general public.


Road\-side infrastructure such as traffic light controllers, roadside
units, traffic monitoring in urban areas and along highways and streets
is wirelessly connected to traffic control centres for management and
control purposes. The backhaul communication between the road\-side
infrastructure and the traffic control centre requires low\-latency, high
communication service availability, and high\-capacity connections for
reliable distribution of data. Road\-side infrastructure is deployed
alongside streets in urban areas and alongside major roads and highways
every 1\-2 km.


For more information about infrastructure backhaul, see clause
D.5\.


To support wireless road\-side infrastructure backhaul the 5G system
shall support the performance requirements in table 7\.2\.3\.2\-1\.


Table 7\.2\.3\.2\-1 Performance requirements for wireless ITS
infrastructure backhaul scenario















| Scenario | Max. allowed end\-to\-end latency (note 1\) | Survival time | Communication service availability (note 2\) | Reliability (note 2\) | User experienced data rate | Payload size (note 3\) | Traffic density (note 4\) | Connection density (note 5\) | Service area dimension (note 6\) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| wireless road\-side infrastructure backhaul | 30 ms | 100 ms | 99,9999% | 99,999% | 10 Mbit/s | Small to big | 10 Gbit/s/km2 | 1 000/km2 | 2 km along a road |
| NOTE 1: This is the maximum end\-to\-end latency allowed for the 5G system to deliver the service in the case the end\-to\-end latency is completely allocated to the 5G system from the UE to the Interface to Data Network. NOTE 2: Communication service availability relates to the service interfaces, and reliability relates to a given system entity. One or more retransmissions of network layer packets can take place in order to satisfy the reliability requirement. NOTE 3: Small: payload typically ≤ 256 bytes NOTE 4: Based on the assumption that all connected applications within the service volume require the user experienced data rate. NOTE 5: Under the assumption of 100% 5G penetration. NOTE 6: Estimates of maximum dimensions; the last figure is the vertical dimension. NOTE 7: All the values in this table are example values and not strict requirements. Deployment configurations should be taken into account when considering service offerings that meet the targets. | | | | | | | | | |


## 7\.3 High\-accuracy positioning


### 7\.3\.1 Description


Adaptability and flexibility are among the key features of the 5G
system to serve a wide diversity of verticals and services, in different
environments (e.g. rural, urban, indoor). This applies to high\-accuracy
positioning and translates into the ability to satisfy different levels
of services and requirements, for instance on performance (e.g.
accuracy, positioning service availability, positioning service latency)
and on functionality (e.g. security).


### 7\.3\.2 Requirements


#### 7\.3\.2\.1 General


The 5G System shall provide different 5G positioning services with
configurable performances working points (e.g. accuracy, positioning
service availability, positioning service latency, energy consumption,
update rate, TTFF) according to the needs of users, operators and third
parties.


The 5G system shall support the combination of 3GPP and non\-3GPP
positioning technologies to achieve performances of the 5G positioning
services better than those achieved using only 3GPP positioning
technologies.


NOTE 1: For instance, the combination of 3GPP positioning
technologies with non\-3GPP positioning technologies such as GNSS (e.g.
Beidou, Galileo, GLONASS, and GPS), Terrestrial Beacon Systems (TBS),
sensors (e.g. barometer, IMU), WLAN/Bluetooth\-based positioning, can
support the improvement of accuracy, positioning service availability,
reliability and/or confidence level, the reduction of positioning
service latency, the increase of the update rate of the position\-related
data, increase the coverage (service area).


NOTE 2: The combination can vary over time to optimise the
performances, and can be the combination of multiple positioning
technologies at the same epoch and/or the combination of multiple
positioning technologies at different epochs.


The corresponding positioning information shall be acquired in a
timely fashion, be reliable, and be available (e.g. it is possible to
determine the position).


UEs shall be able to share positioning information between each other
e.g. to a controller if the location information cannot be processed or
used locally.


#### 7\.3\.2\.2
Requirements for horizontal and vertical positioning service levels


The 5G system shall be able to provide positioning services with the
performances requirements reported in Table 7\.3\.2\.2\-1\.


NOTE: The requirements do not preclude any type of UE, including
specific UE such as for example V2X, MTC.

## 7\.5 High\-availability IoT
traffic


### 7\.5\.1 Description


Several scenarios require the support of highly reliable machine type
communication such as those, typically (but not restricted to) related
to medical monitoring. They involve different deployment areas,
different device speeds and densities and require a high\-availability
communication service to transfer a low data rate uplink data stream
from one or several devices to an application.


Their related performance requirements can be found in table
7\.5\.2\-1\.


### 7\.5\.2 Requirements

## 7\.6 High data rate and low
latency


### 7\.6\.1 AR/VR


Audio\-visual interaction is characterised by a human being
interacting with the environment or people, or controlling a UE, and
relying on audio\-visual feedback. In the use cases like VR and
interactive conversation the latency requirements include the latencies
at the application layer (e.g. codecs), which could be specified outside
of 3GPP.


To support VR environments with low motion\-to\-photon capabilities,
the 5G system shall support:


\- motion\-to\-photon latency in the range of 7 ms to 15ms while
maintaining the required resolution of up to 8k giving user data rate of
up to \[1Gbit/s] and


\- motion\-to\-sound delay of \[\< 20 ms].


NOTE: The motion\-to\-photon latency is defined as the latency between
the physical movement of a user's head and the updated picture in the VR
headset. The motion\-to\-sound latency is the latency between the physical
movement of a user's head and updated sound waves from a head mounted
speaker reaching their ears.


To support interactive task completion during voice conversation, the
5G system shall support low\-delay speech coding for interactive
conversational services (100 ms, one\-way mouth\-to\-ear).


Due to the separate handling of the audio and video component, the 5G
system will have to cater for the VR audio\-video synchronisation in
order to avoid having a negative impact on the user experience (i.e.
viewers detecting lack of synchronization). To support VR environments
the 5G system shall support audio\-video synchronisation thresholds:


\- in the range of \[125 ms to 5 ms] for audio delayed and


\- in the range of \[45 ms to 5 ms] for audio advanced.


The 5G system shall support service continuity for AR/VR to support
immersive user experience under high UE mobility.


When it comes to implementation of applications containing AR/VR
components, the requirements on the 5G network could depend on
architectural choices implementing these services. Note 3 in table 7\.1\-1
above gives an example on such dependences for a VR application in a 5G
system. Table 7\.6\.1\-1 below illustrates additional use cases and
provides more corresponding requirements on the 5G system.


\- Cloud/Edge/Split Rendering – Cloud/Edge/Split Rendering is
characterised by the transition and exchange of the rendering data
between the rendering server and device.


\- Gaming or Training Data Exchanging – This use case is characterised
by the exchange of the gaming or training service data between two 5G
connected AR/VR devices.


\- Consume VR content via tethered VR headset – This use case involves
a tethered VR headset receiving VR content via a connected UE; this
approach alleviates some of the computation complexity required at the
VR headset, by allowing some or all decoding functionality to run
locally at the connected UE. The requirements in the table below refer
to the direct wireless link between the tethered VR headset and the
corresponding connected UE.

| NOTE 1: Unless otherwise specified, all communication via wireless link is between UEs and network node (UE to network node and/or network node to UE) rather than direct wireless links (UE to UE). NOTE 2: Length x width (x height). NOTE 3: Communication includes direct wireless links (UE to UE). NOTE 4: Latency and reliability KPIs can vary based on specific use case/architecture, e.g. for cloud/edge/split rendering, and can be represented by a range of values. NOTE 5: The decoding capability in the VR headset and the encoding/decoding complexity/time of the stream will set the required bit rate and latency over the direct wireless link between the tethered VR headset and its connected UE, bit rate from 100 Mbit/s to \[10] Gbit/s and latency from 5 ms to 10 ms. NOTE 6: The performance requirement is valid for the direct wireless link between the tethered VR headset and its connected UE. NOTE 7: Similar user\-experienced data rates may be achievable also at higher UE speeds. \[50] | | | | | | |

## 7\.9 KPIs for ranging based
services


In several scenarios, it can be beneficial to determine the distance
between two UEs and/or the direction of one UE from the other one via
direct communication connection. The functional requirements related to
ranging based services can be found in clause 6\.37\. Performance
requirements for ranging based services in different scenarios can be
found in table 7\.9\-1\.


Key performance indicators and key attributes for ranging are defined
as follows:


\- **Ranging accuracy**: describes the absolute value of
the deviation of the measured distance and/or direction between two UEs
to the true distance and/or direction value.


\- **Confidence level**: describes the percentage of all
the possible measured distance and/or direction that can be expected to
include the true distance and/or direction considering the ranging
accuracy.


\- **Effective ranging distance**: the largest distance
between the UE who initiates the ranging and target UEs in the ranging
operation.


\- **Line\-of\-sight (LOS) Environment**: the environment
between the UE who initiates the ranging and target UEs, such as LOS and
non\-LOS (NLOS).


\- **Coverage:** type of radio coverage conditions of the
UEs who are involved in ranging, such as in coverage (IC), partial
coverage (PC) and out of coverage (OOC). See also figure 6\.37\.1\-1\.


NOTE: If using licensed spectrum~~,~~ ranging is only
permitted in network coverage under the full control of the operator who
provides the coverage​, except for public safety networks with dedicated
spectrum where ranging might be allowed out of coverage or in partial
coverage as well.


\- **Relative UE velocity**: the target UE can be either
static or mobile relative to the UE who initiates the ranging. In the
latter, the attribute shall also provide some elements about its motion,
e.g. maximum speed, trajectory.


\- **Availability**: percentage value of the amount of
time when a ranging system is able to provide the required
ranging\-related data within the performance targets or requirements
divided by the amount of time the system is expected to provide the
ranging service in a targeted service area.


\- **Latency**: time elapsed between the event that
triggers the determination of the ranging\-related data and the
availability of the ranging\-related data at the ranging system
interface.


**\- Ranging interval:** time difference between two
consecutive ranging operations.

# 8 Security


## 8\.1 Description


IoT introduces new UEs with different life cycles, including IoT
devices with no user interface (e.g. embedded sensors), long life spans
during which an IoT device can change ownership several times (e.g.
consumer goods), and which cannot be pre\-provisioned (e.g. consumer
goods). These drive a need for secure mechanisms to dynamically
establish or refresh credentials and subscriptions. New access
technologies, including licensed and unlicensed, 3GPP and non\-3GPP,
drive a need for access\-independent security that is seamlessly
available while the IoT device is active. High\-end smartphones, UAVs,
and factory automation drive a need for protection against theft and
fraud. A high level of 5G security is essential for critical
communication, e.g. in industrial automation, industrial IoT, and the
Smart Grid. Expansion into enterprise, vehicular, medical, and public
safety markets drive a need for increased end user privacy protection.
5G security addresses all of these new needs while continuing to provide
security consistent with prior 3GPP systems.

Critical\-communication use cases


# D.1 Factory automation –
motion control


## D.1\.0 General


Factory automation requires communications for closed\-loop control
applications. Examples for such applications are motion control of
robots, machine tools, as well as packaging and printing machines. All
other factory automation applications are addressed in Annex D.2\.


The corresponding industrial communication solutions are referred to
as fieldbuses. The pertinent standard suite is IEC 61158\. Note that
clock synchronization is an integral part of fieldbuses that support
motion control use cases.


In motion control applications, a controller interacts with a large
number of sensors and actuators (e.g. up to 100\) that are integrated in
a manufacturing unit. The resulting sensor/actuator density is often
very high (up to 1 m\-3). Many such manufacturing units have
to be supported within close proximity within a factory (e.g. up to 100
in automobile assembly line production).


In a closed\-loop control application, the controller periodically
submits instructions to a set of sensor/actuator devices, which return a
response within a so\-called cycle time. The messages, which are referred
to as telegrams, are typically small (≤ 56 bytes). The cycle time can be
as low as 2 ms, setting stringent end\-to\-end latency constraints on
telegram forwarding (≤ 1 ms). Additional constraints on isochronous
telegram delivery add tight constraints on the lateness (1 μs), and the
communication service has also to be highly available (99,9999%).


Multi\-robot cooperation is a case in closed\-loop control, where a
group of robots collaborate to conduct an action, for example,
symmetrical welding of a car body to minimize deformation. This requires
isochronous operation between all robots. For multi\-robot cooperation,
the lateness (1 µs) is to be interpreted as the lateness among the
command messages of a control event to the group robots.


To meet the stringent requirements of closed\-loop factory automation,
the following considerations have to be taken:


\- Limitation to short\-range communications.


\- Use of direct device connection between the controller and
actuators.


\- Allocation of licensed spectrum. Licensed spectrum can further be
used as a complement to unlicensed spectrum, e.g. to enhance
reliability.


\- Reservation of dedicated radio interface resources for each
link.


\- Combination of multiple diversity techniques to approach the high
reliability target within stringent end\-to\-end latency constraints
(example: frequency, antenna and various forms of spatial diversity,
e.g. via relaying)


\- Utilizing OTA time synchronization to satisfy latency\-variation
constraints for isochronous operation.


A typical industrial closed\-loop motion control application is based
on individual control events. Each closed\-loop control event consists of
a downlink transaction followed by a synchronous uplink transaction,
both of which are executed within a cycle time. Control events within a
manufacturing unit might need to occur isochronously. Factory automation
considers application layer transaction cycles between controller
devices and sensor/actuator devices. Each transaction cycle consists of
(1\) a command sent by the controller to the sensor/actuator (downlink),
(2\) application\-layer processing on the sensor/actuator device, and (3\)
a subsequent response by the sensor/actuator to the controller (uplink).
Cycle time includes the entire transaction from the transmission of a
command by the controller to the reception of a response by the
controller. It includes all lower layer processes and latencies on the
radio interface as well the application\-layer processing time on the
sensor/actuator.


![](media/image5.emf)


Figure D.1\.0\-1: Communication path for isochronous control cycles
within factory units. Step 1 (red): controller requests sensor data (or
an actuator to conduct actuation) from the sensor/actuator (S/A). Step 2
(blue): sensor sends measurement information (or acknowledges actuation)
to controller.


Figure D.1\.0\-1 depicts how communication can occur in factory
automation. In this use case, communication is confined to local
controller\-to\-sensor/actuator interaction within each manufacturing
unit. Repeaters can provide spatial diversity to enhance
reliability.


## D.1\.1 Service area
and connection density


The maximum service volume in motion control is currently set by
hoisting solutions, i.e. cranes, and by the manipulation of large
machine components, e.g. propeller blades of wind\-energy generators.
Cranes can be rather wide and quite high above the shop floor, even
within a factory hall. In addition, they typically travel along an
entire factory hall.


An approximate dimension of the service area is 100 x 100 x 30 m.


Note that production cells are commonly much smaller (\< 10 x 10 x
3 m). There are typically about 10 motion\-control connections in a
production cell, which results in a connection density of up to
105 km\-2.


## D.1\.2 Security


Network access and authorization in an industrial factory deployment
is typically provided and managed by the factory owner with its ID
management, authentication, confidentiality and integrity.


Note that motion control telegrams usually are not encrypted due to
stringent cycle time requirements.


A comprehensive security framework for factories has been described
in IEC 62443\.


# D.2 Factory automation –
other use cases


## D.2\.0 General


Factory automation encompasses all types of production that result in
discrete products: cars, chocolate bars, etc. Automation that addresses
the control of flows and chemical reactions is referred to as process
automation (see clause D.3\). Discrete automation requires communications
for supervisory and open\-loop control applications, as well as process
monitoring and tracking of operations inside an industrial plant. In
these applications, a large number of sensors, which are distributed
over the plant, forward measurement data to process controllers on a
periodic or event\-driven base. Traditionally, wireline field bus
technologies have been used to interconnect sensors and control
equipment. Due to the sizable extension of a plant (up
to10 km2), the large number of sensors, rotary joints, and
the high deployment complexity of wired infrastructure, wireless
solutions have made inroads into industrial process automation.


The related use cases require support of a large number of sensor
devices per plant, as well as high communication service availability
(99,99%). Furthermore, power consumption is relevant since some sensor
devices are battery\-powered with a targeted battery lifetime of several
years (while providing measurement updates every few seconds). Range
also becomes a critical factor due to the low transmit power levels of
the sensors, the large size of the plant, and the high\-reliability
requirements on transport. End\-to\-end latency requirements typically
range between 10 ms and 1 s. User\-experienced data rates can be rather
low since each transaction typically comprises less than 256 bytes.
However, there has been a shift from field busses featuring somewhat
modest data rates (\~ 2 Mbit/s) to those with higher data rates (\~ 10
Mbit/s) due to the increasing number of distributed applications and
"data\-hungry" applications. An example for the latter is the visual
control of production processes. For this application, the user
experienced data rate is typically around 10 Mbit/s and the transmitted
packets are much larger than what was stated earlier.


Existing wireless technologies for factory automation rely on
unlicensed bands. Communication is therefore vulnerable to interference
caused by other technologies (e.g. WLAN). With the stringent
requirements on transport reliability, such interference is detrimental
to proper operation.


The use of licensed spectrum could overcome the vulnerability to
same\-band interference and therefore enable higher reliability.
Utilization of licensed spectrum can be confined to those events where
high interference bursts in unlicensed bands jeopardizes communication
service availability and end\-to\-end latency constraints. This allows
sharing the licensed spectrum between process automation and
conventional mobile services.


Multi\-hop topologies can provide range extension and mesh topologies
can increase reliability through path redundancy. Clock synchronization
will be highly beneficial since it enables more power\-efficient sensor
operation and mesh forwarding.


The corresponding industrial communication solutions are referred to
as fieldbuses. The related standard suite is IEC 61158\.


A typical discrete automation application supports downstream and
upstream data flows between process controllers and sensors/actuators.
The communication consists of individual transactions. The process
controller resides in the plant network. This network interconnects via
base stations to the wireless (mesh\-) network which hosts the
sensor/actuator devices. Typically, each transaction uses less than 256
bytes. An example of a controller\-initiated transaction service flow
is:


1\. The process controller requests sensor data (or an actuator to
conduct actuation). The request is forwarded via the plant network and
the wireless network to the sensors/actuators.


2\. The sensors/actuators process the request and send a replay in
upstream direction to the controller. This reply can contain an
acknowledgement or a measurement reading.


An example of a sensor/actuator device\-initiated transaction service
flow:


1\. The sensor sends a measurement reading to the process controller.
The request is forwarded via the wireless (mesh) network and the plant
network.


2\. The process controller can send an acknowledgement in opposite
direction.


For both controller\- and sensor/actuator\-initiated service flows,
upstream and downstream transactions can occur asynchronously.


Figure D.2\.0\-1 depicts how communication can occur in discrete
automation. In this use case, communication runs between process
controller and sensor/actuator device via the plant network and the
wireless (mesh) network. The wireless (mesh) network can also support
access for handheld devices for supervisory control or process
monitoring purposes.

controllers and sensor/actuator devices. Left\-hand side: Step 1 (red) –

(blue) controller acknowledges. Right\-hand side: Step 1 (red) \-
controller requests sensor data (or an actuator to conduct actuation),
Step 2 (blue): S/A sends measurement information (or acknowledges
actuation) to controller.


## D.2\.1 Service area
and connection density


Factory halls can be rather large and even quite high. We set the
upper limit at 1000 x 1000 x 30 m. Note that the connection density
might vary quite a bit throughout factory halls. The density is, for
instance, much higher along an assembly line than in an overflow buffer.
Also, the density usually increases towards the factory floor.
Typically, there is at least one connection per 10 m2, which
results in a connection density of up to 105
km\-2.


## D.2\.2 Security


Network access and authorization in an industrial factory deployment
is typically provided and managed by the factory owner with its ID
management, authentication, confidentiality and integrity.


A comprehensive security framework for factories has been described
in IEC 62443\.


# D.3 Process automation


## D.3\.0 General


Process automation has much in common with factory automation (see
clause D.2\). Instead of discrete products (cars, chocolate bars, etc.),
process automation addresses the production of bulk products such as
petrol and reactive gases. In contrast to factory automation, motion
control is of limited or no importance. Typical end\-to\-end latencies are
50 ms. User\-experienced data rates, communication service availability,
and connection density vary noticeably between applications. Below, we
describe one emerging use case (remote control via mobile computational
units, clause D.3\.1\) and a contemporary use case (monitoring, clause
D.3\.2\).


Note that automation fieldbuses (see clause D.2\.0\) are also used in
process automation.


## D.3\.1 Remote control


Some of the interactions within a plant are conducted by automated
control applications similar to those described in clause D.2\. Here too,
sensor output is requested in a cyclic fashion, and actuator commands
are sent via the communication network between a controller and the
actuator. Furthermore, there is an emerging need for the control of the
plant by personnel on location. Typically, monitoring and managing of
distributed control systems takes place in a dedicated control room.


Staff deployment to the plant itself occurs, for instance, during
construction and commissioning of a plant and in the start\-up phase of
the processes. In this scenario, the locally deployed staff taps into
the same real\-time data as provided to the control room. These remote
applications require high data rates (\~ 100 Mbit/s) since the staff on
location needs to view inaccessible locations with high definition (e.g.
emergency valves) and since their colleagues in the control room benefit
from high\-definition footage from body cameras (HD or even 4K).


For both kinds of applications, a very high communication service
availability is needed (99,9999%). Typically, only a few control loops
are fully automated and only handful of control personnel is deployed on
location, so that the connection density is rather modest (\~ 1000
km\-2).


## D.3\.2 Process and asset
monitoring


The monitoring of states, e.g. the level of the liquid of process
reactors, is a paramount task in process automation. Due to the
ever\-changing states, measurement data is either pulled or pushed from
the sensors in a cyclic manner. Some sensors are more conveniently
accessed via wireless links, and monitoring of these sensors via
handheld terminals, e.g. during maintenance, is also on the rise. This
kind of application entails rather modest user experienced data rates
(\~ 1 Mbit/s), and since this kind of data is "only" an indicator for,
e.g., what process should be stopped in order to avoid an overflow, and
not for automated control loops, the requirement on communication
service availability is comparably low (99,9%). Note that emergency
valves and such are typically operated locally and do not rely on
communication networks. However, many sensors are deployed in chemical
plants etc., so that connection density can readily reach
10 000 km\-2.


## D.3\.3 Service area


While, for instance, chemical plants and refineries can span over
several square kilometres, the dedicated control rooms are typically
only responsible for a subset of that area. Such subsets are often
referred to as plants, and their typical size is 300 m x 300 m x 50
m.


# D.4
Electric\-power distribution and smart grid


## D.4\.0 General


In TS 22\.104 \[21] clause A.4, typical electric power distribution and
smart grid use cases have been introduced. Here just give some
examples.


## D.4\.1 Medium voltage


### D.4\.1\.0 Overview


An energy\-automation domain that now has standards based support by
mobile\-network technology is the backhaul electricity grid, i.e. the
part of the distribution grid between primary substations (high voltage
🡪 medium voltage) and secondary substations (medium voltage 🡪 low
voltage), and other smart grid services. In figure D.4\.1\.0\-1 we depict a
medium\-voltage ring together with energy\-automation use cases that
either are already deployed or are anticipated within the near
future.


![](media/image7.emf)


Figure D.4\.1\.0\-1: Functional, topological sketch of a medium\-voltage
ring. AMI: advanced metering infrastructure; CB: circuit breaker; DMS:
distribution management system; FISR: fault isolation and system
restoration; HEM: home energy manager; PQ: power quality; RMU: ring main
unit.


The primary substation and the secondary substations are supervised
and controlled by a distribution\-management system (DMS). If
energy\-automation devices in the medium\-voltage power line ring need to
communicate with each other and /or the DMS, a wireless backhaul network
needs to be present (orange "cloud" in figure D.4\.1\.0\-1\).


A majority of applications in electricity distribution adhere to the
communication standard IEC 60870\-5\-104\. However, its modern "cousin" IEC
61850 experiences rapidly increasing popularity. The communication
requirements for IEC 61850 applications can be found in EC 61850\-90\-4\.
Communication in wide\-area networks is described in IEC 61850\-90\-12\.


Usually, power line ring structures have to be open in order to avoid
a power\-imbalance in the ring (green dot in figure D.4\.1\.0 1\). Examples
for energy\-automation that already is implemented in medium\-voltage
grids (albeit in low numbers) are power\-quality measurements and the
measurement of secondary\-substation parameters (temperature, power load,
etc.) \[13]. Other use cases are demand response and the control of
distributed, renewable energy resources (e.g. photovoltaics).


A use case that could also be realised in the future is fault
isolation and system restoration (FISR). FISR automates the management
of faults in the distribution grid. It supports the localization of the
fault, the isolation of the fault, and the restoration of the power
delivery. For this kind of automation, the pertinent sensors and
actuators broadcast telegrams about their states (e.g., "emergency
closer idle") and about actions (e.g., "activating closer") into the
backhaul network. This information is used by the ring main units (RMUs)
as input for their decision algorithms. We illustrate this use of
automation telegrams for an automated FISR event in figure D.4\.1\.0\-1\.
Let us assume the distribution lines are cut at the location indicated
by the bolt of lightning in the figure. In that case, the RMUs between
the bolt and the green load switch (open) will be without power. The
RMUs next to the "bolt" automatically open their load switches after
having sensed the loss of electric connectivity between them. They both
broadcast these actions into the backhaul network. Typically, these
telegrams are repeated many times while the time between adjacent
telegrams increases exponentially. This communication patterns leads to
sudden, distributed surges in the consumed communication bandwidth.
After the RMUs next to the "bolt" have opened their switch, the RMU that
so far has kept the power line ring open (green dot in figure D.4\.1\.0\-1\)
closes the load switch. This event too is broadcasted into the backhaul
network. The typical maximum end\-to\-end latency for this kind of
broadcast is 25 ms with a peak experienced data rate of 10 Mbit/s. Note
that the distribution system typically subscribes to telegrams from all
RMUs in order to keep abreast with the happenings in the distribution
grid.


Automatic fault handling in the distribution grid shortens outage
time and offloads the operators in the distribution control centre for
more complicated situations. Therefore, automated FISR can help to
improve performance indexes like System Average Interruption Duration
Index and System Average Interruption Frequency Index.


Automation telegrams are typically distributed via domain multicast.
As explained above, the related communication pattern can be "bursty",
i.e. only few automation telegrams are sent when the distribution
network operates nominally (\~ 1 kbit/s), but, for instance, a disruption
in the power line triggers a short\-lived avalanche of telegrams from
related applications in the ring (≥ 1 Mbit/s).


### D.4\.1\.1 Service
area and connection density


Service coverage is only required along the medium\-voltage line. In
Europe, the line often forms a loop (see figure D.4\.1\.0\-1\), while
deployments in other countries, e.g. the USA, tend to extend linearly
over distances up to \~ 100 km. The vertical dimension of the poles in a
medium voltages line is typically less than 40 m. Especially in urban
areas, the number of ring main units can be rather large (\> 10
km\-2), and the number of connections to each ring main unit
is expected to increase swiftly once economical, suitable wireless
connectivity becomes available. We predict connection densities of up to
1\.000 km\-2.


### D.4\.1\.2 Security


Due to its central role in virtually every country on earth,
electricity distribution is heavily regulated. Security assessments for,
e.g. deployments in North America, need to adhere to the NERC CIP suite
\[14]. Technical implementations are described in standard suites such as
IEC 62351\.


## D.4\.2 High voltage


### D.4\.2\.0 Overview


In order to avoid region\- or even nation\-wide power outages,
wide\-area power system protection is on the rise. "When a major power
system disturbance occurs, protection and control actions are required
to stop the power system degradation, restore the system to a normal
state, and minimize the impact of the disturbance. The present control
actions are not designed for a fast\-developing disturbance and can be
too slow. Local protection systems are not able to consider the overall
system, which can be affected by the disturbance. Wide area disturbance
protection is a concept of using system\-wide information and sending
selected local information to a remote location to counteract
propagation of the major disturbances in the power system." \[15].
Protection actions include, "among others, changes in demand (e.g. load
shedding), changes in generation or system configuration to maintain
system stability or integrity and specific actions to maintain or
restore acceptable voltage levels." \[16]. One specific application is
phasor measurement for the stabilisation of the alternating\-current
phase in a transport network. For this, the voltage phase is measured
locally and sent to a remote\-control centre. There, this information is
processed, and automated actions are triggered. One action can be the
submission of telegrams to power plants, instructing them to either
accelerate or deaccelerate their power generators in order to keep the
voltage phase in the transport network stable. A comprehensive overview
of this topic can be found elsewhere in the literature \[17].


This kind of automation requires very low end\-to\-end latencies (5 ms)
\[16] and―due to its critical importance for the operation of society―a
very high communication service availability (99,9999%).


### D.4\.2\.1 Service
area and connection density


As is the case for medium\-voltage distribution networks (see Annex
D.4\.1\), connectivity in high\-voltage automation has to be provided
mainly along the power line. The distances to be covered can be
substantial (hundreds of kilometres in rural settings), while shorter
links are prevalent in metropolitan areas. The number of connections in
wide\-area power system protection is rather low; but―due to the
sliver\-shaped service area―the connection density can be rather high
(1000 km\-2).


### D.4\.2\.2 Security


Due to its central role in virtually every country on earth,
electricity distribution is heavily regulated. Security assessments for,
e.g. deployments in North America, need to adhere to the NERC CIP suite
\[14]. Technical implementations are described in standard suites such as
IEC 62351\.


# D.5
Intelligent transport systems – infrastructure backhaul


## D.5\.0 General


Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) embrace a wide variety of
communications\-related applications that are intended to increase travel
safety, minimize environmental impact, improve traffic management, and
maximize the benefits of transportation to both commercial users and the
general public. Over recent years, the emphasis in intelligent vehicle
research has turned to co\-operative systems, in which the traffic
participants (vehicles, bicycles, pedestrians, etc.) communicate with
each other and/or with the infrastructure.


Cooperative ITS is the term used to describe technology that allows
vehicles to become connected to each other, and to the infrastructure
and other parts of the transport network. In addition to what drivers
can immediately see around them, and what vehicle sensors can detect,
all parts of the transport system will increasingly be able to share
information to improve decision making. Thus, this technology can
improve road safety through avoiding collisions, but also assist in
reducing congestion and improving traffic flows, and reduce
environmental impacts. Once the basic technology is in place as a
platform, an array of applications can be developed.


Cooperative ITS can greatly increase the quality and reliability of
information available about vehicles, their location and the road
environment. In the future, cars will know the location of road works
and the switching phases of traffic lights ahead, and they will be able
to react accordingly. This will make for safer and more convenient
travel and faster arrival at the destination. On\-board driver
assistance, coupled with two\-way communication between vehicles and
between vehicles and road infrastructure, can help drivers to better
control their vehicle and hence have positive effects in terms of safety
and traffic efficiency. An important role in this plays the so\-called
road side units (RSUs). Vehicles can also function as sensors reporting
weather and road conditions including incidents. In this way, cars can
be used as information sources for high\-quality information
services.


RSUs are connected to the traffic control centre for management and
control purposes. They broadcast, e.g., traffic light information (RSU 🡪
vehicle) and traffic information from the traffic\-control centre (TCC)
via the RSU to the vehicles (TCC 🡪 RSU 🡪 vehicle). RSUs also collect
vehicle probe data for the traffic control centre (vehicle 🡪 RSU 🡪 TCC).
For reliable distribution of data, low\-latency and high\-capacity
connections between RSUs (e.g. traffic lights, traffic signs, etc.) and
the TCC are required. This type of application comes with rather tight
end\-to\-end latency requirements for the communication service between
RSU and TCC (10 ms), since relayed data needs to be processed in the TCC
and, if needed, the results are forwarded to neighbouring RSUs. Also,
the availability of the communication service has to be very high
(99,9999%) in order to compete with existing wired technology and in
order to justify the costly deployment and maintenance of RSUs.
Furthermore, due to considerably large aggregation areas (see clause
D.5\.1\), considerable amounts of data need to be backhauled to the TCC
(up to 10 Mbit/s per RSU).


## D.5\.1 Service area
and connection density


It is relatively hard to provide estimates for the service area
dimension. One reason is that it depends on the placement of the base
station relative to the RSUs. Also, the RSUs can, in principle, act as
relay nodes for each other. The service area dimension stated in table
7\.2\.3\.2\-1 indicates the size of the typical data collection area of an
RSU (2 km along a road), from which the minimum spacing of RSUs can be
inferred. The connection density can be quite high in case data is
relayed between RSUs, i.e. along the road (1000 km\-2).

QoS Monitoring 


# F.1 QoS monitoring for
assurance


This Clause discusses how QoS monitoring information can be used for
assurance purposes. For background information on assurance see \[19] and
appendix A.3 in \[20].


Assurance consists of four major steps (see Figure F.1\-1 and
\[18]):


* *Customer's QoS requirements*



> These state the level of quality required by the customer of a
> service. This information is divulged to the provider.


* *Service provider's offerings of QoS (or planned/targeted
QoS)*



> This is a statement of the level of quality expected to be offered to
> the customer by the service provider.


* *QoS achieved/delivered*



> This is the level of quality achieved and delivered to the customer.
> Monitoring information is divulged to the customer.


* *Customer rating of QoS*



> The customer can compare the QoS achieved by the provider with the
> QoS requirements (see above) and its own experience of the QoS. This is
> a crucial step for establishing assurance about the fulfillment of the
> customer's requirements.


![](media/image8.emf)


Figure F.1\-1: QoS assurance by use of QoS monitoring information



> NOTE: This Figure is based on the trust model in reference \[18].


The start time and the duration of the QoS monitoring is specified in
the parameter *observation time interval*, which is exchanged
between the customer, for instance an application consuming a
communication service, and the provider (for instance a private 5G
network providing a communication service). The observation time
interval is the time interval during which a series of measurements is
conducted. In the context of QoS monitoring, these are the measurements
necessary for assessing the QoS of communication services, for instance
the measurement of end\-to\-end latencies.


Examples of parameters to be monitored by the provider are given in
annex C in reference \[36].


# F.2 Network Diagnostics


Network diagnostics helps with scanning, diagnosing and identifying
problems within a network. Diagnostics includes gathering data and
continuously providing sufficient performance parameters that
characterize the quality of the network connection. This includes data
of the physical connection as well as of logical links and sub\-networks.
Exposure of relevant (and possibly aggregated) performance parameters
ensures a quick reaction in case of failure as well as identifying
network connectivity, performance and other related problems. Network
diagnostic should be able to:


\- be proactive (to early detect failures) and not only reactive (to
deal with faults that have already occurred).


\- accurately differentiate malfunctions/failures and evaluate their
impact on the service/network.


\- provide clear explanations about what happened.


\- suggest corrective actions, and possibly perform them
automatically.


Furthermore, specific connectivity information is also of interest as
well as usage information (e.g. traffic load) of the node (e.g.
RAN).


Network diagnostic information needs to be generated automatically
and, in case of a hosted or virtual network deployment, be made
available to the tenant of the network via a suitable API.

(informative):  

Asset Tracking use cases


# G.1 Asset Tracking


Every organisation owns assets (e.g. machines, medical devices,
containers, pallets, trolleys). These assets are often not stationary:
they are transported all over the world by different kinds of vehicles;
and the assets are also moved inside various kinds of buildings.


The ownership of assets can change many times during the life\-cycle
of the asset as different stakeholders take possession of the assets and
pass them on to other stakeholders along the supply chain and value
chain.


So, many stakeholders want to track their assets anytime and anywhere
(indoor \& outdoor) in a global and multi\-modal context (e.g. sea,
air, road, rail).


The asset tracking topic implies more than just knowing the location
of an asset. Asset tracking includes real time and/or time\-stamped
monitoring of several asset\-related properties depending on the asset
and its content (e.g. condition of the asset and changes, environmental
factors – temperature, mechanical shock).


The 5G system provides the capability to better support asset
tracking in all its aspects in particular in term of coverage (need to
support full coverage: e.g. indoor / urban / rural / harsh environments
/ metallic obstructions on land, sea) with the support of terrestrial
and non\- terrestrial network as well as use of relays when necessary and
in term of energy efficiency (15 to 20 years’ lifetime of an asset
tracking device without changing the battery or the UE).


# G.2
Battery life expectancy and message size to support example use cases
for asset tracking


For asset tracking it is important to be able to have the asset on
the field during a period corresponding to the life of the asset without
changing the UE or the battery of the UE.


The battery life expectancy, message size and device density values
required to support the potential opportunities in various asset
tracking use cases are summarised in table G.2\-1


Table G.2\-1: Battery life expectancy and message size to support
example use cases for asset tracking














|  | Scenario | Battery Life Expectancy (note 1\) | Typical Message size | Maximum Message size | Typical Frequency (number of messages per day) | Typical Battery Capacity | Device density | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Containers (note 2\) | 12 years | 200 bytes | 2500 bytes | 24 | 21,6 Wh | 1,4 devices / m3 | |
| 2 | Wagons | 20 years | 200 bytes | 2500 bytes | 24 | 36 Wh | 0,3 devices / m2 | |
| 3 | Pallets | 7 years | 300 bytes | 300 bytes | 24 | 12 Wh | 4 devices/ m2 | |
| NOTE 1: Battery life expectancy is to be assumed in all coverage conditions and is based on typical message size value and typical frequency NOTE 2: A large containership with a mix of 20 ft and 40 ft containers is assumed. NOTE 3: All the values in this table are targeted values and not strict requirements. | | | | | | | |  |

H (informative):  

Interworking between Network Operators and Application Providers for
localized services


This clause illustrates examples of scenarios applicable for
interworking between hosting network operators (PLMN or NPN) and data
applications based on service agreements for localized services among
network operators and application/service providers:


* Hosting network operator owns the 5G network which provides
access and IP connectivity to serving UEs.
* Network operator owned application layer entities, e.g.,
including Service Hosting Environment, or IMS network.
* Application platforms in third party domain can be owned by third
party application/service providers, or home/other network
operators.
* The Application platforms could be application servers (e.g.,
Video on Demand Server, Cloud gaming server, etc.), 3rd party software
development platforms, and third party/operator Service Hosting
Environments.


The following figures show the collaborative relationship in three
domains including network operators providing access and IP
connectivity, network operators providing services via IMS/application
platforms, and application/service providers providing services via
application platforms or applications. The dashed line between visited
hosting network operator and Home network operator is based on service
level localized service agreement and the horizontal line represents the
demarcation between the network operator domains and the 3rd party
domain. In an operator network, the application layer entities can
include IMS network, Application platforms, and API Gateway for third
party applications developed using APIs (e.g., REST, GSMA OneAPI).


Figure H\-1 provides the home operator owned/collaborative
interworking scenarios where traffic is routed to home network operator
and applications are delivered by the home operator via interworking
agreements between network operators.

NOTE: The other network operators and service/application operators
in 3rd party domain provides collaborative services in application
platforms to Home operator. The arrow solid line represents the traffics
routed over domains within home operator network while the arrow dash
lines represent the traffics routed over domains outside of home
operator network.


Figure H\-2 provides hosting network operator owned and collaborative
interworking scenarios between visited hosting network operator and
operators in 3rd party domains where traffic is routed to application
from the hosting network to 1\) hosting network owned application
platforms, 2\) collaborative home network owned application platforms,
and 3\) third parties via interworking agreements between visited hosting
network operator and home/other network operators, and between hosting
network operator and other application/service providers.

Other interworking scenarios are not excluded.


  

Annex I (informative):  

Indirect Network Sharing of NG\-RAN Sharing


This annex clarifies scenarios applicable for Indirect Network
Sharing between a Shared NG\-RAN and the corresponding participating
operator's core network as alternatives for operators who intend to
deploy a NG Radio Access Network. Examples of such scenarios include
wide\-range coverage of rural areas, long\-distance road coverage,
compatibility with existing networks, service consistency, cooperation
with diverse networks, considering different operators' strategies,
commercial agreements, and specific rules/legislation in different
countries.


Two or more operators have deployed or plan to deploy 5G access
networks and core networks with MOCN. The challenge for the network
operators is the maintenance generated by the interconnection (e.g.,
number of network interfaces) between the shared RAN and two or more
core networks, especially for a large number of shared base stations.
For these reasons, it is valuable to introduce a newly supported network
sharing scenario as the operators' agreement.


In case of Indirect Network Sharing, the communication between the
Shared NG\-RAN and the Participating Operator’s core network happens via
a number of inter\-operator interfaces that are independent of the actual
number of base stations at the Hosting NG\-RAN Operator.


There is an agreement between all the operators to work together and
build a shared network together cover the entire country, utilizing the
different operator’s allocated spectrum appropriately in different parts
of the coverage area (for example, Low Traffic Areas and High Traffic
Areas). Multiple operators share one NG\-RAN, but their 5GCs are
independent. UEs access their subscribed PLMN services and/or subscribed
services, including Hosted Services, provided by their participating
operators respectively, when entering the Shared NG\-RAN.


The following figures illustrate the example in which Indirect
Network Sharing is realized via routing through the Hosting Operator’s
core network.


\- The Hosting NG\-RAN Operator 1, as illustrated below, can share its
NG\-RAN with the participating operators with or without direct
connections between the shared access and the core networks of the
participating operators.


\- The Participating NG\-RAN Operators 2 and 3, using shared NG\-RAN
resources provided by the Hosting NG\-RAN Operator, e.g., within a
specific 5G frequency band or within a specific area, when the Shared
NG\-RAN does not have direct connections between the shared access and
the core networks of the Participating NG\-RAN Operators 2 and 3\.


\- The Participating NG\-RAN Operator 4, using shared NG\-RAN resources
provided by the Hosting NG\-RAN Operator, with direct connections between
the shared NG\-RAN and the core networks of the participating operator,
is in a MOCN arrangement.


![1685089507576](media/image11.png)


Figure I\-1: Different options both direct and indirect connections
between the Shared NG\-RAN and the core networks of the participating
operators.


![](media/image12.png)


Figure I\-2: Indirect Network Sharing scenario involving core network
of Hosting NG\-RAN Operator between the Shared NG\-RAN and the core
networks of the participating operators.


The network sharing partners can set a specific sharing allocation
model for the network sharing method they are using. The collection of
charging information associated with the sharing method that the UE
accesses with can be possible. It is also necessary to understand the
charging information between the networks of both parties, e.g., the
number of the users, and how long users using a certain shared network
method will take. This information is also needed when users use the
participating operator's hosted services they have subscribed to and
their flexible charging via Shared NG\-RAN.


Annex J
(informative):  

Store and Forward Satellite operation


The Store and Forward Satellite operation in a 5G system with
satellite access is intended to provide some level of communication
service for UEs under satellite coverage with intermittent/temporary
satellite connectivity (e.g. when the satellite is not connected via a
feeder link or via ISL to the ground network) for delay\-tolerant
communication service.


An example of “S\&F Satellite operation” is illustrated in Figure
J\-1, in contrast to what could be considered the current assumption for
the “normal/default Satellite operation” of a 5G system with satellite
access.


As shown in Figure J\-1:


* Under “normal/default Satellite operation” mode, signalling and
data traffic exchange between a UE with satellite access and the remote
ground network requires the service and feeder links to be active
simultaneously, so that, at the time that the UE interacts over the
service link with the satellite, there is a continuous end\-to\-end
connectivity path between the UE, the satellite and the ground
network.


\- In contrast, under “S\&F Satellite operation” mode, the
end\-to\-end exchange of signalling/data traffic is now handled as a
combination of two steps not concurrent in time (Step A and B in
Figure J\-1\). In Step A, signalling/data exchange between the UE and the
satellite takes place, without the satellite being simultaneously
connected to the ground network (i.e. the satellite is able to operate
the service link without an active feeder link connection). In Step B,
connectivity between the satellite and the ground network is established
so that communication between the satellite and the ground network can
take place. So, the satellite moves from being connected to the UE in
step A to being connected to the ground network in step B.

Figure J\-1: Illustration of “normal/default operation” and “S\&F
Satellite operation” modes in a 5G system with satellite access.


The concept of “S\&F” service is widely used in the fields of
delay\-tolerant networking and disruption\-tolerant networking. In 3GPP
context, a service that could be assimilated to an S\&F service is
SMS, for which there is no need to have an end\-to\-end connectivity
between the end\-points (e.g. an end\-point can be a UE and the other an
application server) but only between the end\-points and the SMSC which
acts as an intermediate node in charge of storing and relying.


The support of S\&F Satellite operation is especially suited for
the delivery of delay\-tolerant/non\-real\-time IoT satellite services with
NGSO satellites.
